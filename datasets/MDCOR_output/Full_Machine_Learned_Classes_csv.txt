"V2"	0.471	0.928	"The best is for Biden to stay in the race to be elected president.  To appease the worries about his age,  he should plan to serve only a short time of the 4 years.  He is fine today after 4 years, he should be fine for a little time more. AND IF NOT,  he will be replaced by his vice-president.  He is free to choose who his running mate will be,  and he should choose THE BEST person to replace him, even if this is not the Kamala.  I think that Pete Buttigieg is the best qualified, who will be also THE YOUNGEST,  therefore compensating for Biden's age.  This will guarantee a very important CONTINUITY of the good government we have now, and Biden can give especial importance to coach and pass on his experience and knowledge to Pete.  Then, when Biden retires in a short while, like a year or less, we will have a YOUNG president who continues making progress."	"UgzoBIAROKbyqkXjE6R4AaABAg"	"4"

"V2"	0.847	0.928	"(. . . - - - . . .) After this poor performance by Joe R Biden Jr. In the 2024 Presidential ‚Äúdebate‚Äù with former President Donald J. Trump, and now for Biden to have any chance to WIN the 2024 U S. Presidential election, Koe R. Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden's Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November,¬† to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? All voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr¬† would be handing the Presidential Office to His history making centrest, and Independent politicaly thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III soon after the 2024 Election 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, ‚Äúall-ready‚Äù to be a calming force often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus¬† building, Independent President demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken likable human being with excellent communications skills aa United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation‚Äôs Leaders to govern, and, most important to heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this task ahead, or the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! Joe Biden‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùTime to Man Up‚Äù. Make the right choice, at the right time who should better be the Country's Vice President who will make right these United States as the next U.S. President, and to the benifit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should br our best forward facing identity, decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential performance, and our then combined united agreement in such. So as you often say, Joe R. Biden Jr. , ‚ÄúCut The Malarkey‚Äù of having ¬†Kammla Harris as your 2024 Democratic V.P. running mate ! Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by vering away from the Political Polerrzation of today deviding ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù with a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III by your side now until November 2024. Why because a centrist moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward (. . . - - - . . .)

All networks need to show Biden's answers to most questions AGAIN as DT just lies & insults instead of answering ANY questions. Actual dementia doesn't come & go as quickly as his stumbles at the END of long, Factual statements show. But his life long stutter is why he lost track of his clear train of thought. A stutter's brain leaps ahead in it's thoughts & says words out of context. Based on working with special need kids & psychology. But 99% of Biden's answers were clear & on point. While he revealed later the cold he had was severe enough that they tested him for covid & the flu. But the media has crucified Biden for his flubs without ONE WORD on the lies & taunts by DT.

Trump goes of on a tangent talking about things not pertinent to the question, preferring instead, to engage in ad hominem attacks on Biden. Biden and his team appear to have thought about the issues at hand and made an attempt to find solutions.
I think the United States would be best served by giving the Biden administration another four years in office, even if it means that the Vice President will have to take over half way through.

Only the market can appropriately set prices to close the mass balance.  Creating jobs is a pointless goal to begin with.   Anyone can create an infinite number of jobs - just have people dig holes and then fill them back in.  If that sounds stupid, then randomly giving tax money yo create new construction jobs should sound exactly the same way because it literally is the same thing.  Giving money to build things that the market doesnt need or want is the same thing as digging holes and filling them back in.  It wastes time and resources that could be used for things that the market (aka the people) actually want or need.  Also, PSA: american citizens pay tariffs, not the countries shipping the goods to us.  Tariffs only increase the price of goods for americans, and prop up businesses that arent competitive to begin with.  If you want to pay more for the same product, go right ahead but dont vote for tariffs that force everyone to do that.

As there is no one who can not get saved, if they make the choice to come to God and do so. :[)

1.Realize that all of mankind have sinned before God in one way or another.

Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 
10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
11.There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
12.They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
23. ‚ÄúFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.‚Äù

2.Realize that God loved us enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, by his blood shed on the cross, as a free gift given to us as sinners.

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)
8. ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
9.Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
12. ‚ÄúWherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:‚Äù

3.Confess unto God to accept this freely given gift of forgiveness, that forgives all sins.

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.‚Äù
3.For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;‚Äù
4.And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:‚Äù

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. ‚ÄúThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.‚Äù
10.For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
13.For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
28.So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.‚Äù

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.‚Äù

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù

Lastly, here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.
‚ÄúDear God, I am a sinner and need saving. 
I know I‚Äôm not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus‚Äô name, Amen.‚Äù"	"Ugw4ROIZWYiFl2BRee54AaABAg"	"1062"

We  can not afford to buy grociers. our mortgages are steadily rising, and our mortgage insurance is out of the box. We can barely afford to live. Why? Because you Biden are making us pay YOU back for all the money you gave out for Covid all the billions you are steadily giving to foreign countries. Our nation is falling. You and the democratic party do not in any way care about the people. You only care about destroying our nation and everything in it. People, if you can not see what has happened, sine Biden came into office,  then please wake up. Trump is correct on the Hispanic taking the jobs, look, around you  paying attention. I feel like I am in another world. Who would have ever thought you would be paying  out the box to try and survive. Biden you do not have to worry because you and the democrats have all the money you need you don't have to worry about where you will live or if you going to eat . My mom told me when I was young when the Republicans are in office everything is good and for the people when the democrats are in office everything falls apart because they are not for the parople and their country. Your own family is not right making you do this when it's obvious that you have Dementia. How sad is this. People do not like Trump because he says it like it is. He speaks the truth. He is in control and he knows business that is very important in someone who is running our country. The thing that is for certain is that Biden open border was to gain all their votes on the upcoming election. That is why they are living better than we are. Honestly it does not matter what color a person is or where they are from we are ALL created by one amazing God. Jesus Christ, he is coming back, and he is the one who will destroy ALL evilness and hatred  in this world. We need to pray for peace and love and happiness. Love and pray for  your enemies. Repent your sins and turn to our lord and savior Jesus Christ before it is to late. Sisters and brothers please see the truth in this matter. It's OUR lively hood our lives our childrens  lives that are at steak here. Trump is right World War lll is right around the corner. Pray about your decision üôè

     If one of the two debaters is willing to use the tactic of 'gish-galloping' then the gish-galloper, from the standpoint of a troubling number of bystanders watching, will always rhetorically fully win that debate and any debate. 

     The downside to using gish-galloping to gain rhetorical auto-wins in any debate is that the night after fact-checkers finally finish their rundown of all of the in-factualities told during your gish-gallop, you lose an incredible amount of the trust people had in you, for all people that hear and believe what the fact-checkers have to say about your gish-gallop, for all days after that debate.

This sounds like its the exact thing China wants. If It's cheaper to do business over there, companies will move overseas. That keeps money central to China's economy (or other countries with cheaper taxes) That creates an economy where money flows from the US to foreign entities. Raising taxes won't fix anything. It will do the opposite. It will cause more inflation, prevent us from burning down our deficit, and keep our competitors in business. We need to build up our economy. We need to reward the wealthy because they are the backbone of our economy. Raising taxes won't fix frivolous government spending, it will ENCOURAGE it. We need to SPEND LESS, cut funding from programs that aren't essential and we will be fine. Less spending makes a stronger economy. When businesses have to pay more they raise prices. When they have to pay less, they charge less for their goods and services. This creates an economy that encourages spending and everyone wins. Did this guy forget to take an economics class?"

I kind of want Trump to win honestly even though I disagree with him more. 

My worry is that if Biden is elected A LOT of democrats might switch to being republicans due to how horrible of a leader he is.
Then if Trump is not the lead republican next year we might get someone like Ron Desantis who will destroy our already struggling schools and help create a massively Christian leaning curriculum.

There were no new manufacturing jobs under Trump only low wage jobs, Trump lied about pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord claiming it would cost America money Trump pulled out because Trump had the EPA lift regulations on polluters greedy petroleum companies and coal companies polluted the air and water thanks to Dummy Trump. Trump did NOTHING for Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as far as helping them advance so they can prepare Black students for the corporate world, Trump had former Education Secretary Betsy Du Bois to sucker Black single mothers to enroll their children in loser public charter schools instead of investing in state public schools in Black communities. Trump did NOTHING for Black people they worked two jobs,Trump did NOTHING for veterans there were still veterans sleeping on the streets of Washington DC the VA did not help veterans, Trump's racist immigration policies hurt illegal Hispanic families Trump had children in cages, and parents in holding cells.

If a person's citizenship is in Bolivia, by law he cannot vote in American elections, or for that matter, in any country's elections other than Bolivia's. Even so, a Christian who is a citizen of heaven should not vote in an election of a nation on earth.

II Corinthians 5.20¬†adds another principle: We are¬†ambassadors for Christ. Paul is specifically speaking of Christian ministers (see¬†Ephesians 6.20), but the principle applies to all Christians, since those Christ has called are to be emissaries for Him before¬†the world¬†(Matthew 5 13-16;¬†Philippians 2 15;¬†II Peter 2 11-12; etc.). If the ambassador from Mozambique were to meddle in the affairs of the United States, even by merely trying to vote, he would be in violation of international law. In the same way, a Christian, an ambassador of Christ's government, cannot interfere in the affairs of another sovereign nation.

Jesus¬†Himself provides a third principle in¬†John 17 16:¬†They [His disciples, Christians] are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. When God calls a person to¬†repentance¬†and conversion, the new Christian is summoned to forsake his former allegiances and throw his hand in with Christ. We see in the apostle Paul that he considered everything before his conversion to be rubbish; his loyalty was fixed entirely with Christ from that point on (Philippians 3 3-11). If an American renounces his citizenship and takes citizenship in another country, he is no longer allowed to vote in American elections‚Äîit is not his country. A true Christian must treat his citizenship in the same manner; he is truly not of this world but of the¬†Kingdom of God¬†(Colossians 1 13; see also¬†John 15.19;¬†18.36;¬†James 4.4;¬†Revelation 18.4)."

We're looking for collaborating and speaking more about our electoral marathon! Would love correspondence. 

P.S.,
Hope you don't mind the promoting
(please would you tell me if you don't)

üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Merkleykraft, '24! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
We'll kiss, we'll hold hands, and we'll get married in front of our entire United States of America!

üíåRy Kraft for President!

Let's 
bring our pride back to our United States of America!

Let's
make America better again!

Why,
does our Registry have over 60,000 in our registry, here in the Portland metropolis alone, but only 1,000 are notarized? It's common sense issues like these that our fellows believe have been well-established decades ago, when in reality, we're at basic level on so many pressing issues! And, also,
This is one that will most definitively get funded!


When I become (Vice) President, 
the first thing I'd do is sign off on a couple crucial Executive Orders 
focused on Mental Health and wellness in our leading Enforcement positions:
‚àö Hiring Therapists and or Psychiatrists per Precinct with a client/doctor confidentiality, keeping our Officers on the force and maintaining a non-bias, non-mandated reporter-type basis; reprimanding, retraining, not removing;
‚àö Hiring at least (1) Law Professional per State to mitigate negligible, reoccurring persons and cases to escalate and determine an equitable, fair outcome prior to all-or-nothing offenses occur; to aid, not (necessarily) make life changes or decisions;
‚àö Mandating CDL-Training (and potentially Hiring Process mitigation) within our Prison System, and a broader-scaled Technical Training within our Jail System;
as well as
‚àö Hiring, at the very least, a graveyard crew of ~7, per state, maintaining our Country's registry.
These,
I wholeheartedly believe key, when building upon, holding, and in keeping, a career. There should never be despondency; 
if 
there's an issue, should we not be alotted to on-the-job training?
if 
there's emotional turmoil, should we not be alotted on-the-job resources?
if
we're to be hired initially, should we not have job security?
In Every Job Position!

Then there's 
‚Ä¢ border protection which is absolutely imperative; 
Key fundamentals of Democratic policies like:
‚Ä¢ maintaining Women's Rights (my body, my choice) in her right for an abortion, equality in the workspace, and full equality in general; 
‚Ä¢ fighting for our citizens and trying to be the voice for everyone; 
‚Ä¢ lowering our deficit;
‚Ä¢ focusing on Climate Change in every aspect from Agriculture and Permaculture, to species (on the brink of extinction) rehabilitation and reassimilation, to finding better pesticide and insecticide products that won't harm our critical, benign insects like pollinators and seasonal nomadic; to stopping Any New big Oil and Gas development agreements;
‚Ä¢ working with all our World Leaders to create policies best for us, as the United States of America, but also best for our World, globally; 
and
so much more

I would change so much of our marginalized communities, as I can surely stress that it's these citizens who take the brunt, from every level. The disparages of our system can seem unbearable and starting from the bottom, all the way to the top, one step at a time, is how we'll enact a more equitable society. 
But, I'm still too young (VP only!)

We need to come together as the United States of America;
namely,
We all must work; if we've need supplement of our Govt., as Nationals, we must Volunteer at the least, strictly in maintaining our Society. Every one of us United States of America Nationals deserve Housing, a Job, and Financial Aid;
maintaining one designated building in the heart of every downtown, in every City, to supply these needs will promote so much growth in such a rough market that we do currently face.

Building upon our Democratic leadership that I follow in direct cadence, we must:
‚Ä¢ focus on Police Reform, Criminal Reform, and in fixing our Mental Health System;
‚Ä¢ building upon from the bottom to the top, the middle out, focusing on creating jobs in all sectors in Semiconductors, Food Processing, Manufacturing; and absolutely
‚Ä¢ focusing on bad banking practices and in fixing these issues, in predatory lending, triple loans, reliance on Corporations too big to fail; 
then there's even
‚Ä¢ Housing Reform:
(1) Deed, per citizen, and or persons with dependents; negotiable, not mandatory; implementations:(1) House, (1) Apartment Complex, (1) Lease, (1) Corporation, (1) Entity, (1) building High-rise; simple! It's clear to see that the Real Estate market is leading our Economy and Society without a single thread of oversight, and it's with shortsighted policies like these that skew, misrepresent, and shatter the current divide of our current American society;
‚Ä¢ Immigration Reform:
Process and Deportation with a negotiable Warning or added Criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous;
‚Ä¢ Refugee Asylum Reform:
Strict Background Check and applicating process, Case Management oversight with weekly (1)+ hour appointments, mandatory job seeking (3)+ per appointment, Governmental subsidies never be granted ~(10)+ years, supplemental housing never be granted ~(10)+ years;
‚Ä¢ Filibuster Reform:
Perfect Proposals, instrumental Acts, life-changing Bills, imperative Amendments that are yielded on the floor, with a system in place of voted-upon of Yeays or Nays, unless getting at least the simple majority in the House (218/435), and concurrently the simple majority in the Senate (51/100), they're dead on arrival, and the only pressure we have is filibustering. Eliminating motions that bring bills to the Senate floor, eliminating filibustering Amendments, and eliminating the no-effort filibuster, would give every Senator a voice but not a veto;
‚Ä¢ Homelessness Initiatives:
1...Public Loos, in every City!
2...Public electrical outlets, in every City!
3...Public LaborReady locales to work for (at least) $20.00/day, in every City!
as these basic necessities are not only overlooked, but unprovided as it stands; Whereas, public defication is Illegal; Whereas, loitering is illegal; Whereas, businesses bar our public from even using their services without exchange(s) of monies; Whereas, finding (3) pennies is all that's promised from walking any citystreets for (24)-hours;
‚Ä¢ Corporate Credited Reform:
Many Corporations have enabled Refinancing, Loans, credit APRs that at least double mandated-payments with massive interest hikes, risky Mortgages that necessitate paycheck-to-paycheck (20)-year payments, and these practices benefit mostly these Entities, while leaving so many of our fellow Americans in close to impossible arrears;
‚Ä¢ Judicial Reform:
When so many massive discrepancies, credible, unjust lawsuits getting completely swept under the rug with dismissals, incredulous taking sides and one-sided judgements, we need an Infrastructure system in place to have oversight over these types of scenarios; a much more involved Supreme Court;
‚Ä¢ Financial Regulatory Reform:
Bad banking practices affect our entire Nation on nearly all levels, from the bottom to the top, with a select few able to regulate. And, it is all-encompassing. Measures to assist our fellow citizens with a Risk Assessor, Payment Deliberator, and or an Accountant,  who work for their clientele in reversing foreclosures, stopping bankruptcies, defusing exclusions, and in having a Judge to strictly mitigate Banking cases, will ease these monumental deficits;
and
so very much more!

All our best!

Out of all the 90 minutes of the debate, there's barely any question that was answered, they were just having a chit-chat of arguing that the opponent's the worst presidents. When they're being ask about whether they're capable of being elected as the President of the United States for the next 4 years, what the debaters being arguing is about golf... Is this even revelent to the question? 
Literally, no solution that was given to solve these problems, espically for whether womens have the right to abortion. Joe Biden over there were just talking about a case that happened when there was a women that was rapped by illegal immigrants, whereas Donald Trump over there were blaming Joe Biden for letting the illegal immigrants into the border (and that's basically what Trump being saying throughout the debate). I wonder if Joe Biden has been drinking alcohol before the debate, because he's seriously drunk by mentioning about illegal immigrants rapping an women when he's the person who's responsible for opening up the border at Texas.

but let‚Äôs be real here, Trump is WAY better than Joe in terms of points and topics, though he lied what appears to be over 30 times, he is still the crowd favourite and better that the other one (Biden).

There was a time in the US where moderate Republicans and Democrats shared common interests together, despite their political and ideological differences. It is THAT order which Trump and his cult followers have shaken up since 2016, followed by the Biden counter-block now which isn't any better either. It's bad for the peace of both sides, since they are being taken over by the extreme fringes on either side now, as I said. And this will only create more division domestically.

By the way, here in Europe and especially in Germany we have experiences over many decades with left-wing and right-wing radicals always at each other's throats, since neither of them will ever compromise to the other extreme. Hence they are not solving any problems, only creating more chaos. That's why we have additional political parties in the center in Europe who can tame both sides and introduce common ground and consensus in a professional manner accepted by everyone. They say Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy were such Presidents, to name some American equivalents in history. Bringing lefties and righties together has never been easy though.

I am not a doctor, but I know what that looks like.  

Does it mean he is suffering from Parkinson‚Äôs?  Not necessarily.

There are a lot of things that can look like Parkinson‚Äôs.

Does it mean he needs to be looked at and monitored?  Yes.

He could just be sick with something. I don‚Äôt know because I haven‚Äôt watched him over the years.

People would have to watch him over the next debates and his daily interactions.  You don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs dealing with. There might be other forces at play that we just don‚Äôt know about.

I will say this:  I know Exactly what that looks like to me- but again, I am no doctor and I don‚Äôt watch the news or TV very much at all.

The only way to truly know is for him to take levodopa carbidopa and watch what happens.









- I will say this- if he decides to run again, his aides, his top advisors, and any professors that are in his confidence will be more pronounced, as they Should be anyway.
- If he is suffering in silence, you would see (effectively) mostly just his Aides and professors, which ultimately you have to decide if that‚Äôs a good or bad thing.
- he needs to stay active in order to not get locked up, if it is the case.  He would need therapy (physical, occupational and linguistically) daily, and constant interaction.

For any person suffering from it, what matters is having meaning and seeing the people that matter most to you.

RFK jnr is the nephew of JF Kennedy, who was president in the 50s and 60s. 
Check out The Real Debate to see him in the debate alongside Trump and Biden, using the Internet tech to skip over CNN and the two parties trying to exclude him, smear him, and pretend he doesn't exist. 

He was the best debater by far, actually having intelligent solutions about the real issues we are facing. For example - Americans have had a 22 percent hike in home insurance and are paying $4 for a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread and $6 for a gallon of gas, then he added: It's because of the forever wars and out-of-control spending by these two gentlemen ... this is the reason they need me on stage, because I will confront them with what they did.

Presently 43 States have time limits on Welfare-GA programs. You can Google this.

In years past a number of Republicans had put time limits also on Welfare-GA benefits. 

People on Social Security and Welfare programs are citiizens  too, so allow this  into this debate. President Joe Biden said in present debate as he is running for President now  that a number of Republicans want to end Social Security. So very sad indeed!

Children,Frail Elderly, Disabled, Blind, Veterans and Spouses are on Social Security which was  put into Law by Congress in 1935 to keep Elderly from starving and not be in need.

They have Constitutional Rights as well. They are  Christianly Christians too on Social.Security and Welfare programs. So have a fear of God and Jesus too. 

People need Food, Safe Shelter and Jobs to live.

The vice president should be chosen by us. This one is not fit. They usually arent.

There should be an age limit for presidents.

At least Biden will have people to guide him. Trump will just have other criminals saying 
Yes Boss!

The Joker is, of course, unacceptable in any circumstance. He is a fascist and dangerous.

"V6"	0.691	0.977	"Hitler and Trump similarities:

Use of Propaganda:

Hitler: Utilized propaganda extensively to spread Nazi ideology, control public perception, and demonize opponents. Joseph Goebbels, his Minister of Propaganda, played a key role in this.

Trump: Frequently used social media and rallies to communicate directly with his base, often bypassing traditional media. He also labeled mainstream media as fake news to undermine their credibility.

Populist Rhetoric:

Hitler: Promoted a nationalist agenda, blaming Jews and other minorities for Germany's problems and promising to restore Germany to its former glory.

Trump: Used populist themes, emphasizing America First, and often blamed immigrants, foreign nations, and political elites for America's issues.

Charismatic Leadership:

Hitler: Cultivated a strong, authoritative image, presenting himself as the savior of Germany.

Trump: Presented himself as a strong leader who could fix the country‚Äôs problems, often portraying himself as an outsider fighting against a corrupt establishment.

Scapegoating:

Hitler: Blamed Jews, communists, and other groups for Germany's economic and social woes, leading to severe persecution.

Trump: Frequently blamed immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim-majority countries, as well as political opponents for various issues facing the United States.

Rallying Support through Mass Gatherings:

Hitler: Organized large rallies, such as those in Nuremberg, to energize his supporters and project power.

Trump: Held frequent rallies across the country to maintain enthusiasm among his base and project strength.

Disdain for Democratic Norms:

Hitler: Exploited the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic‚Äôs democratic system to gain power and ultimately dismantle it.

Trump: Criticized various democratic institutions and norms, including questioning the legitimacy of elections and the integrity of the judicial system"	"UgwMfluFUvLsIbjYsgp4AaABAg"	"5187"

Fake! The condition of the economy was not due to Trump, but due to the pandemic and due to Governor's who mandated the closing of businesses in their states. He was not responsible for that condition other than to say it would have been worse had he not done the things he did. What Mr. Trump left me suggests that what was left was of his doing and it absolutely was not.

2). We had an economy that was in free fall

Lie - people were starting to get vaccines in December and things were  already rapidly returning to normal by late January. Things weren't falling, they were rising.

3). The pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying and all he said was 'it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach into your arm you'll be alright.

Objectively-Lie, Lie, Lie
A. The pandemic wasn't mishandled. They did try their best, supplying the CDC with the resources to do it's work. Doctors, not politicians lead the response. If social distancing and masking were not effective I wouldn't blame the administration or even the medical scientists who were limited in what could be done. There was no great silver bullet they missed. A great and effective grand thing that would make all the difference. It was small things that had small impacts.

B. Many people were dying, that's true. But anything that comes after the statement of all he said would be a deliberate misrepresentation unless it contained ALL of what he said.

C. The statement he attributed to him was nothing even remotely close to what he said... and it wasn't even based on something he said. It was based on a question he asked someone while not addressing the press. Something he found interesting. That statement was a complete lie and deliberately misleading anyone who heard it. Trump never even used the word bleach. He did use the word disinfectant. A person with a virus is infected. To disinfect a person infected with a virus is to inject an antiviral medication. A virus killer. Antivirus is a disinfectant because it comes in contact with a virus and the virus dies. Antibodies attack infections. The therapy monoclonal antibodies used man made proteins that acted like antibodies in that they bound to the virus and destroyed it. As they disinfected an infected person, and it was an IV injection, they actually did inject people with a type of disinfectant.

4. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs

Absolutely FALSE!!! Businesses couldn't hire because no one wanted to work. Businesses had to struggle to get staff to return as he was taking office. TONS of jobs, no people.

5. The unemployment rate rose to 15%

Lie.... he asked us to look at what he left us. Joe took office late January of 2021, did he not? The month of January 2021 had a 6.3% unemployment rate and was coming down nearly half a percent (.4%). Not as bad as Joe states it and improving. The rebound had begun. The difference between 6.3% and 15% is HUGE!!! Double the 6.3 to 12.6% and you are still way off by thousands and thousands.

If you wanna say he wanted to say that's how bad it once was, he should also give Trump credit for getting it from 15% down to 6.3%. But as you listen, the intent was to make Biden look like he was the one that conquered the 15% unemployment obstacle. No, he spent trillions taking us from 6.3 to around 4%. His goal was to make his achievement look better than it was.

* Next was some pointless words with no claims.

6. We created 15,000 new jobs
               üòØ
I put that face because of his next statement:

We brought out...
(Ahem)
In a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs

False. This can't be accurate... if you have 800,000 NEW manufacturing jobs, how can you have only created 15,000 jobs? Which one is false because we aren't that bad at math that we can't see one or both are fake numbers. You can't call it truth.

PS: Giving government contracts from money the government doesn't have and thus spending tomorrow's money now is robbing future tax collections. That enlarges the money supply.... that's how you caused the inflation. 

He actually gave one of the answers to thr question here... we created jobs with government money. It's the people who took these jobs and spent their paychecks buying stuff that caused inflation.

Good luck in getting him to acknowledge they over stimulated the economy and that did it. He's probably not smart enough to know that."	"UgzZeQfgyBoBGfgjSmN4AaABAg"	"5302"

Note Trump sidestepped his position on Ukraine Russia should keep all land it [invaded] now occupies. He also pivoted on the issue of taxing the rich. Illegal immigration actually rose when Trump was in power, he restricted legal migration which could benefit America; building a wall is pointless when illegal immigrants can use boats to avoid it. If Biden continues he must become more assertive as Americans equate confidence with security. It scares me that America may vote for Trump who has a long history of crime, corruption, deception & scandal & would like to have the full authority of Putin over America.

I'm not even pro trump, but Joe DID seek retribution, and what's sad is it's not even surprising. I highly doubt the founding fathers included the 4th amendment with the idea it could be circumvented by one mans reasonable suspicion. America was built off of freedom, yet ppl isn't even free to control their own consciousness. This is the country that technically defines addiction as a disease but nonviolent addicts take up much of the prison space costing something to the tune of $80,000 each per year...some sitting 20 year sentences for a drug that is now legal and sold in stores....Im willing to bet a ONE time payment of $80,000 would've prevented SO much suffering, ultimately getting passed down for generations if used towards prevention, with mental health resources.

But I find it hilarious that the so-called experts say: 'Trump won the debate'....
Let' summarize his results:
1. He never answered the exact questions, and when he sometimes did, he lied shamelessly.
2. He was throwing great words like 'best ever' and 'worst ever' without any foundation or source.
3. He was like a whining child from the daycare: 'the veterans/soldiers like me better than him' and so on... 
4. He showed no sign that he has any kind of program for the future administration at all...
Yes, if you see HOW they talked, maybe Trump was better, but in a political debate/discussion it is way more important WHAT they say. From a professional point of view it was more meaningful what Biden said... and he was trying to answer the questions he received not to avoid them."	"Ugx2t3y7yAkLN7tyuPt4AaABAg"	"6234"

The President of the USA, it turns out, is not only the President of the USA, it is one of the, if not the, President(s) of the entire world. However, only Americans get to vote.

From an European perspective, no one wants Trump. I wonder if people in the Middle East or other parts of the world are any different. Granted, Putin will probably prefer Trump.

All I can ask to the American people is to please be responsible when voting, because the world is in a mess, wars in Ukraine, Palestine, Sudan, etc., and your leader is not just your leader. He is one of, if not the, main leader(s) of the world.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the United States has provided substantial aid to Ukraine. As of early 2024, the total amount of aid approved by Congress for Ukraine stands at nearly $175 billion. This includes a mix of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.

Military Aid: The largest portion of this aid, approximately $117.4 billion, has been allocated for defense-related purposes. This includes weapons systems, training, and intelligence support for the Ukrainian military.
Economic Support: Around $34.8 billion has been provided through the Economic Support Fund, aimed at sustaining essential government services in Ukraine, such as law enforcement and other critical infrastructure.
Humanitarian Aid: An estimated $22.6 billion has been dedicated to humanitarian efforts, including support for refugees and other forms of economic assistance.
Much of this funding is used not only to directly support Ukraine but also to replenish U.S. military stockpiles and support defense manufacturing within the United States‚Äã (Council on Foreign Relations)‚Äã‚Äã (CRFB)‚Äã‚Äã (CSIS)‚Äã."	"UgwJg9zXuCDvMSHV75l4AaABAg"	"6350"

Guys, I‚Äôm from Russia, we don‚Äôt want to capture anyone, this is propaganda! That we all drink vodka and have our own personal bear. You are being fooled, middle class!  Also, we live very well, the sanctions have not affected us at all. We live the same way we lived! Only your president transfers money to Ukraine, and your broken equipment appears with us! Guys, we are very friendly, come, I can show you Moscow. And it‚Äôs a pity for you that your president, like a ‚Äúguppy fish‚Äù Biden, is clearly not himself.  I'm sorry that your president is keeping the whole world in suspense. I recommend watching the interview with Tucker) I also had a good laugh at your old man, Biden is just a character from a stupid American comedy like Scary Movie.  I feel sorry for you, but if Biden remains in power, I will order myself a beer and watch Biden‚Äôs address as a humorous character, his eyes, mouth, facial expressions, speech, it‚Äôs just as if it‚Äôs surreal!!!

"V1"	0.73	1	"Leaving NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) could have several significant negative consequences for a member country. Here are some key reasons why it might not be a good idea:

Security and Defense:

Collective Defense: NATO's principle of collective defense (Article 5) means that an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. This provides a significant deterrent against potential aggressors.
Military Support: NATO members benefit from the military capabilities and strategic assets of other member nations. Leaving NATO would mean losing access to this extensive support network.
Geopolitical Influence:

Global Influence: NATO membership enhances a country's influence on the global stage. Member states participate in high-level discussions and decision-making processes on international security and defense.
Regional Stability: NATO plays a crucial role in maintaining stability in Europe and its neighboring regions. Leaving NATO could diminish a country's influence in these areas and weaken regional security.
Economic Implications:

Defense Spending: NATO members share the burden of defense spending, which can help reduce individual costs. Outside of NATO, a country might have to increase its defense budget significantly to compensate for the loss of collective security.
Economic Security: Stability provided by NATO contributes to economic security and investor confidence. Leaving NATO could create uncertainty and negatively impact the economy.
Political Relationships:

Alliances and Partnerships: NATO fosters strong political and military alliances among member countries. Leaving could strain these relationships and isolate the country from important allies.
Diplomatic Support: Being part of NATO ensures diplomatic backing from other member countries in times of crisis. This support would be harder to come by outside the alliance.
Technological and Intelligence Sharing:

Advanced Technology: NATO members benefit from shared access to advanced military technology and innovations. Leaving NATO could limit access to such resources.
Intelligence Cooperation: NATO facilitates extensive intelligence sharing among its members. This cooperation enhances national security by providing critical information on potential threats.
Historical and Moral Commitment:

Commitment to Democratic Values: NATO promotes democratic values and the rule of law. Leaving NATO could be perceived as a step away from these principles.
Historical Alliances: Many countries have long-standing historical ties and commitments to NATO. Leaving the alliance could undermine these historical relationships and commitments.
Overall, leaving NATO could undermine national security, weaken geopolitical influence, strain economic stability, and diminish important political and military alliances. The benefits of membership, including collective defense, shared resources, and enhanced global standing, far outweigh the potential drawbacks of withdrawal."	"Ugz-NXw0mr-NVxRVqDZ4AaABAg"	"6812"

They entered a bakery together, but both of them found that they had no money on them. Hillary hesitated for a moment, then took advantage of the clerk's lack of attention and reached out to take three pastries and hid them in her pocket. She whispered to Trump, You see how smart I am, the shopkeeper didn't see anything, and I don't even need to lie. I will definitely defeat you and win the presidency of the United States! Trump said, Is it your usual style to act deceitfully and steal in order to achieve your goals? In fact, you can also achieve the same result in an honest way. Look at me! So Trump said to the bakery owner, I am the Republican presidential candidate Trump, and I will perform a magic trick for you to show me. Please help me pass this pastry to me. The shop owner was very curious and immediately gave him a piece of pastry as he instructed. Trump wolfed it down and asked for another piece, but also swallowed it. Then Trump ordered a third piece of cake and took another bite into his stomach. At this moment, the shop owner was a bit puzzled and asked Trump when the magic would appear. Trump replied, Now is the time to witness miracles. The three cakes from earlier were all in Hillary's pocket."	"Ugz_vEvxIXauMQJZQlh4AaABAg"	"6944"

Trump did great as MY president he is not a close person in my personal life, so why should I care if he did F*cked a pornstar all those years ago, and if he lied about it so what. I do not know the full story of Jan 6., but we can not just sit here and listen to he said or what she said. Apparently Jan 6 was really bad people got hurt/killed and trump did nothing about that, but I have not looked into it to see proof or what, but again how can I trust that info when i cant even trust what i see on YT or whatever. I don't know what is a lie and whats not, but what I do know is that everyone is now in complete shock when the see Biden on stage by himself completely fail at his job. how in the world did the dems not see this coming. trump did his part and in 2016-2020 there were no wars there was no inflation, my dad was not struggling this much, I heard nothing about the border or Afghanistan. I just wish people really take a look at this debate and see why trump would be a better president. I would rather have a person who looks strong and can talk, AND also has a past of doing great things.

There's no reason for a lock and security company to slow down if you think about it.  And then there's the current governor of California and the jerks in Sacramento who want to gut me as a small business owner. My company was way busier when Trump was in and everybody was running and gunning..We were running like headless chickens. The commercial and industrial market was hammering! My customers had money and plans. There's still good construction going on in San Diego, but the interest rates, inflation, and regulations, and whatever else, have an arm around the neck of a company like mine.

What has changed is my perception of the Democrats led by their much too old POTUS, Joe Biden. I held this party to a higher standard predominantly due to their more noble rhetoric. However, given the reports of the Democratic leadership after the June 27 Presidential debate, my conclusion sadly is that both parties are similar in substance but differ in style. Both leaders only care about power at the expense of all else including the welfare of the country. Since both crave unadulterated power, the sycophantic handlers around them can‚Äôt help cuz they also don't want to hit the unemployment line anytime soon. This is the corrosive effect of an endless supply of money into the system creating more disparity between the classes. Didn‚Äôt history teach us this is the foundation for revolution? Is Trump just the logical next step in America‚Äôs evolution?

Pundits say this corruption, fueled by donor  money, accelerated since the Reagan era. Not much time left to correct the course of American Democracy once held as the ideal for the rest of the world to aspire. Perhaps we've all been deluded by the perceived nobility of men.

I also held out faith for the FLOTUS to do the right thing but she is proving to be yet another sycophant. Everything is about status and power mirroring their spouse. In that sense the despicable MAGA's are more honest.

If the Democrats think they can defeat Trump with the current Biden then they are delusional. If the world thinks that America is the beacon of Democracy paid by the blood of their WW2 veterans then the rest of us are delusional.

He did not lie about anything of substance to the debate questions thrown his way. If you can prove he lied, then don't just say he lied, explain how when and why you believe he lied.

I watched the whole debate, where did trump lie, he corrected biden several times they weren't lies, he said he left and handed biden a great start which he did, even though covid had hit hard by then, things were still fairly stable, he did reduce ilegal immigration to a all time low, had unemployment at a 50yr low, fuel and other costs were low, taxes were less thus more in the workers pockets, no wars started on his watch, were the lies. Biden did remove or delete 90 odd exec orders, the only way trump could get anything done cause dems rejected everything or said would agree if he agreed to fund numerous waste of tax papers mobey projects, biden did start of with vaccines already out and working, jobs bouncing back, borders opening, shops reopening, 1.7% inflation, a secure border happy voters still, still no wars and a secure border.

Bidens 1st 100 days, inflation starts, food fuel and other costs increase, interest rates became higher, wages value plummeting, ilegal immigration increases, crime increases, taxed laws, no bail jail cards. Where are the lies. Seems to me, the d3mocratic baklvkers and voters have been lied to, they have been kept in the dark about just how bad biden had got in 3 years."

On MSNBC the most left partison Democratic news network in the world, Chuck Todd, the voice of Meet the Press, said that many in the Democratic party are now arguing that Biden has to be replaced as the Democratic candidate.   On CNN, Van Johnson said to be clear I love Joe Biden., but This was painful. Be fair, likely the results of this debate will be that Trump likely will gain 5% nationally in the polls pushing Biden's vote down into the low 30s.  Biden has been loosing for some time now and been failing publically, but there will be no recovery for his candidacy now.  The donations to Trump will double, and the donations now for Biden will fall like a rock.  Biden has won the Democrat nomination, but he is not capable to run for re-election.  For the sake of the country, and his party, Joe Biden shouild release his delegates and have his Party select an alternate nominee to represent the Party.

In contrast, Donald Trump is very effective in front of the camera and has a strong ability to deliver his message convincingly, but his lack of sincerity in serving the people undermines his effectiveness as a president. It's unfair that Biden faces discrimination because of his stutter, and voters should support him based on his ability to deliver on his policies and his dedication to serving the American people. STOP THE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST JOE BIDEN ON HIS DISORDER. DO NOT LET THE PUNDITS DESTROY YOUR VOTES. STAND WITH JOE BIDEN. EVEN  HIS OWN DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE DISCRIMINATING HIM, SO UNFAIR.

Thinking a little outside the box ... think Kamala Harris for pres and Adam Kinzinger (R) for VP.

There are millions of Never Trumper Repubs who would stay home before voting for trump, (trump's hardcore base is about 35%) and Kinzinger gives the OTHER 15% of Repubs the option of voting Dem WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE! 

THIS OPTION WOULD BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER!!! and I feel MOST REAL AMERICANS very tired of ALL the divisiveness!!!

Kamala would keep the women/black/and moderate Dem wings, plus she is already a well known face who is already well qualified. Latest polling I've seen is that Kamala is only 1-2 pts (after the debate) behind trump in a one on one. I even think many Dems/Indes could like Kinzinger ... he is not a crazy trumpster!!

trump is the most dangerous person to EVER run, he is simply Hitler reincarnated. He simply promised the rich more riches for their vote!!

And just as Hitler destroyed Germany in 10 years through gross miscalculation and winnable wars, trump could see the US destroyed in just 15 minutes by being stupid and a single miscalculation sparking a nuclear war. 

In an estimated nuclear war.... 500 MILLION to 4 billion!! I think (and I am VERY Hopeful) the military has already put into effect internal controls that would prevent a-like trump madman from setting of a world-ending conflict!  (Remember very small scale trump's easy to win trade war??!!??)
 
Plus the Repubs could NOT say that It (whatever IT is ...... immigration, inflation, Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, etc) , is all the Dems fault. It breaks a very important link to the Dems if Biden is gone. Inflation is a result of what the FEDS do ... NOT the Administration does. But the Administration does get blamed.

Let's reunite the USA again! Let Biden's legacy would be that he stepped aside to strengthen America, not because he was weak ... but smart ... Country over self!!!

"V6"	0.612	0.977	"Here is what everyone needs to understand about dementia. It is progressive and President Biden definitely has it. The fact that he is functional from 10-4 shows that he is sundowning, which is what he was doing on the debate stage at 9pm. He shuffles when he walks. He often has a frozen stance and a blank stare with a gaped mouth. He is often unsure which way to go to get off a stage. These are clear signs of dementia. His handlers won't let him do press conferences or answer free form questions. It is absolutely dangerous that our enemies have seen this display. My dad had dementia and could be very lucid and logical when he was rested and hydrated. He would become disoriented when he was tired, and what I saw on the debate stage from President Biden was exactly what I would see with my dad when he was tired. The fact that he is using travel and a cold as an excuse is ridiculous. The president should be able to function 24/7 with frequent travel and an occasional cold. This is no excuse for that display. And remember dementia is progressive once it starts. So you can't say he has been great the last 4 years so he should be trusted with the presidency. This makes no sense with dementia. He is just going to get worse. And it is not diagnosable with a brain scan. Alzheimers can only be definitively diagnosed through an autopsy. A cognitive test may or may not determine dementia depending on the moment when it is taken. I saw my dad pass a cognitive test even when he was delusional about other things later that same day or during that same week. During this same time, he would drive down the street and then forget which way to come home. President Biden has dementia. I am completely convinced of this and every American who saw the debate and has seen dementia in a family member is as well. How do I vote for someone with this condition? We couldn't let my dad be in charge of the simple aspects of his life. I had to help him with his pills and doctor appointments. The leader of the Free World cannot have dementia!

Trump, and now for Biden to have any chance to WIN the 2024 U S. Presidential election, So how to make the present situation a positive win for Joe R. Biden Jr., The Nation, and its People ? Joe R. Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden's Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November, to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? Most voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr¬† would be mentoring as the Senior Statesman He is, to eventually hand over the Presidential Office to His history-making centrest, and Independent politically thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III at any time after a 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, ‚Äúall-ready‚Äù to be a calming force who is often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus¬† building, Independent person. Presidenting, and demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership like that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken, likable human being, with high integrity, showing excellent communications skills as United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect centered choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation‚Äôs Leaders to govern, and, most important to reset, then heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity and, away from the National collective abyss coming seemingly closer each day. I can envision a President Joe Manchin the third, as a true uniter the Country needs most, having a White House Cabinet, and Administration full of moderate thinking, U.S. Citizens always and, above all, wishing to focus on a better life for We the People. An administration built from a mix Democratic, Independant, and Republican bent folks successfully managing together the people's business in a common sense first, thoughtful, daily approach fashion who foremost always emulate a President Joe Manchin III‚Äôs mannerisms. How pleasing to all it would be to have a United States Executive branch who puts People‚Äôs needs before Political Parties needs. I‚Äôm for a history making period like that, so many others would be too, as the way to reunite the United States of America while showing decorum. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this momentous task ahead, or even the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! President Joe Biden, honestly it is your time to ‚ÄúMan Up‚Äù,‚Äùprotect the Country that you have sworn to protect‚Äù, and put ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù first, and above personal needs of Yourself, the desires of Family members or your best political party associate's types who , you know, most unfortunately put ‚ÄúParty First Before Country‚Äù who walk a very miss guided, warped, power first desiresies above all else agenda path. Joe R. Biden Jr. please cast these influencers aside, make the right choice, at the right time, for our Country, of who would be the better Vice President, who will make right what is not right within these United States as the next U.S. President, to the benefit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should be our best forward facing identity, together when less divided we can decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential centrest performance, and our then combined united agreement in such. So as you often say, Joe R. Biden Jr. , ‚ÄúCut The Malarkey‚Äù of having ¬†Kamala Harris as your 2024 Democratic V.P. running mate ! Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by veering away from the Political Polarization of today dividing ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù with selecting a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III to have close by your side now until November 2024, and on to Win the Whitehouse for a second term this November. Why because a centrist thinking moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward to right what's wrong with the United States read another way ‚Äúus‚Äù.

The media complains that he goes way, way off topic and needs to stick to them. It is perfectly fine that Trump has them and should be using them more. On the other side is Biden. He has access too, he uses them as well. Now media and maybe some democrates are saying that the teleprompters are not good, for Biden anyway, and he needs to use his own voice and thoughts and not rely on those same teleprompters. I've been raised, and believe, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If it's ok for Trump to have them, then it's okay for Biden. Look, I understand the importance of that first debate. Regardless, 1 bad debate doesn't negate all he has done. The facts haven't changed. Biden is only in this race because Trump announced his candidacy super early. I'm sure there was discussion on whether or not to join the race. If he gets pulled out now, all bets are off, Trump wins and our children and grandchildren grow up in Russia but on American soil. Instead of fleeing the ship, maybe our democratic leaders should swim back to the ship and help to bail water and keep it from fully submerging. Yes, both men are old, after this I really hope Congress will pass mandatory retirement age for presidents, or add a no older than age to the restrictions. None of this matters if Trump wins or tries to steal the election. With Biden we have a chance of success, then we can all breath easy for democracy has been saved . Of course with the new supreme court rulings, he could just have Trump and his followers assasinated due to the extreme threat every single one of them are to this country.

I love Biden and I like Harris, and it pains me to say this but having even the most qualified woman at the top of the ticket (be it Harris or Whitmer) could end up another Hillary 2.0.  Too many Trump voters are grievance based, and in this case Dems need to put identity politics aside and nominate a surer thing, an Obama-class performer.  (This is strategy, not misogyny.)

The only people doing well right now are the rich, Wall Street, and politicians. Inflation is still rampant. Interest rates are high (I don‚Äôt think they are THAT high). Governments are preventing the building of homes through regulations. Cars are expensive because of the EV push causing manufacturers to switch powertrains and plans last minute, causing them to lose money and that is passed onto the consumer. Chip shortage also didn‚Äôt help and that wasn‚Äôt the presidents fault. 

I don‚Äôt think the economy would have been MUCH different under Trump. I think, it would have been better, just slightly. 

No extra 2021 stimulus check. No free money through interest rates being easy. No crying about a vaccine mandate, while inflation was sky high in 2021-2022. Oil production took a hit in those years of the EV push.

1. Short term economy 

2. Long term economy

‚Äî‚Äîboth of these just like at macro statistics and not the average and median growth has been. Just overall GDP growth. So if the GDP grew but only the top 5% of Americans get it (which is what‚Äôs happening recently) then the stats don‚Äôt matter- so these two are actually FALSE. Why? Well because money has been going to the top 5% not the the rest of the 95% of voters. So to THEM the economy long and short term is actually bad. 

3. Scandal key

‚Äî‚Äîsubjective. Biden has extreme distaste from veterans. Many many voters believe he is not mentally fit. That id scandalous. But trump doesn‚Äôt get this either. 

4. Charisma

‚Äî‚Äîjust no. Trump has much more charisma than biden and being unbiased here. Narrow audience? His events are PACKED with people. Biden‚Äôs are not: this is completely subjective and the professor is showing favoritism here.

5. Third party 

‚Äî-RFK is losing polling numbers so he‚Äôs not at all going to steal votes soon.

6. Social unrest‚Äî- my bad I guess all the Israel and Palestine protests just don‚Äôt count in all the major cities.

7. Foreign military success/failure. Trump gets this key. Biden failed in Afghanistan, has failed to end the ukraine war, and has failed to end the Middle East war. Compared to trump which has a legacy of not having. Any major war.

I doubt Lichtman or Biden would like the current answer to the question, Are you better off than you were 4 years ago?

On Charisma, Lichtman claims, without putting too fine a point on it, that Trump has a narrow appeal to people with a certain mind set. Trump has pulled more non-republican voters than any republican candidate ever, and polls are moving his way. 

Scandal. C'mon, Lichtman. How can you present Hunter Biden's scandals in a vacuum and think you're being honest? Hunter, other family members, and friends wouldn't have made a dime off of China or Ukraine if his daddy wasn't VP, and now president. Talk about a president who's beholden to foreign interests!

"V1"	0.518	1	"How about this:

1) Inflation is higher 

2) Cost of common goods and commodities have risen $2.50 - $4.00 since 2019

3) Ukraine conflict has risen its death toll to approximately 535,000 deaths since Putin invaded.  This death toll only reflects that of Ukrainian and/or NATO/Coalition forces.  Russia invaded Ukraine after the humiliating departure of the US out of Afghanistan.

4) there are roughly 9 US hostages being held in Afghanistan today in 2024. Although it has been reported, they‚Äôve been given respect, good quarter, and being fed all connections to what is called for, and the Geneva convention, but yet still has not been released.

5) Afghanistan withdrawal was reactive at best, hasty, and sloppy, leaving over $1 billion in equipment, military, advancements, and land in air warfare navigation systems.

6) BLM scams hundreds of donors and is found to be a disorganized grifting scheme.  Was then later dismantled then shortly after decentralized to different groups throughout the US unrelated to one another. With the founders somewhat disappearing from the spotlight with one of the founders moving to Canada. 

7) military getting involved in identity politics, have extremely weakened our forces. Reports have been given throughout the ranks, and lack of arsenal and weaponry. 

8) over $1 billion and aid given to the Ukraine in a unwinnable war with over 545,000 lives lost on the Ukraine and coalition side. Biden has reported he does not send money but weapons to the Ukraine, which are over $1 billion. All these weapons are being misused, destroyed, and otherwise lost in the battlefield of an unwinnable war.

9) local terrorist group who unfortunately run the Gaza strip, and that a Palestine power one of the 18 tribes within Palestine, Hamas, had a few of its militants raid towns and events, killing both women and children in a sudden surprise attack.

10) more money being printed, and being sent to Israel to fund more bombing campaigns and other resources in the Middle East and Israel.  

11) recap so far, we have two foreign wars that break out, and an embarrassing withdrawal from a 15+ year war, high inflation rates, hostages left behind.

12) Biden administration talks about gun control and they need to stop guns but yet release one of the worlds largest arms dealer in exchange for a WNBA player who has spoken out against her own country and was found with an illegal substance in Russia.

13) transvestite privileges, and other weird sexual niche groups calling for reform in our own government in order for them to have power over our children. Teaching kids before they even learn about sex, about homosexuality and multiple genders that are nothing more than a fantasy.

14) world leaders are turning their backs on our country, saying that they feel for America and hope they get better? Really?

15) Joe Biden calls the president of China a dictator right in his face in California SMH

16) California far left governor Gavin Newsom, made California, essentially an area of low income and Haven for vagrants. With beautiful street corners and alleys, now littered with homeless, tents and vagrancy throughout. So much that local businesses in the area have installed water hoses on the top of their roof to ensure that no tents are propped up against their buildings.

17) a president who can hardly remember what day it is literally, being sent out to negotiate with world leaders that are on top of their game. God knows what has been said in those meetings. We see the frustration of some leaders like the leader of Brazil basically yelling at Joe Biden for not paying attention at a rally he attended back in 2022. 

18) evidence arise of the president and his son conducting business deals on the backend with foreign nationals and businesses utilizing the backing of this political background, to get signatures to get money flowing into Biden‚Äòs pockets, not Americas.

19) lie lie about Donald Trump have been proven. It‚Äôs not only his own supporters, but also Democrats alike.

19) the current United States cabinet literally having no functionality whatsoever, but just meeting. They just meet to plan other meetings. Literally there is nothing being done. We are just plopped up. That‚Äôs it.

20) utilizing a false narrative that racial injustices, abortion, and project 2025 is the issue with the United States as well as climate change, meanwhile the same people protesting against that are becoming poor as the day goes by and wonder why it cost over $10 for a carton of eggs

21) 250,000 jobs lost from the oil, rigs and roughnecks who worked those rigs without a job as soon as Biden went into Office. This is inevitably caused oil prices to increase nearly $2.50 more and rising.

22) huge auto decline nationwide increasing prices for vehicles. 

23) illusion that more jobs are being created and the economy is in ‚Äúgood condition‚Äù just because your ‚Äúblack rocks‚Äù and other similar organizations have so much dead money to work with they are buying up all real estate and neighborhoods through the United States.

24) our economy is so great according to Biden that interest rates went from being 3.75% back in 2019 now over 9% lol üòÇ causing the housing market to gradually decrease in activity

25) Mass influx of illegal immigration once known as ‚Äúasylum‚Äú are now a disorganized mess being labeled ‚Äúimmigration‚Äú with no type of processes, checks of balances, with women, being raped and women and children killed with over four incidents in the US so far. New York neighborhoods and luxury hotel buildings have been vacated for the mass influx of immigration and people who have nothing to bring to this country other than exploits and their own grief and drama.

26) inflation is bad, but immigration is even worse, with it spreading all over the other US states now every state is almost like a border state with no checks and balances as stated above. The VP, who is still in charge of the border, has evidently and apparently ignored that entire task and does nothing but assigned blame and point the finger when asked questions about it and changes the subject with anger.

27) we have an unfit president who is well over his timeline and cannot think properly and a jealous vice president who secretly hates the person she is under. Rumors of constant feuding within the cabinet has been reported throughout the Biden administration presidency, which is unprofessional.

28) further pandering to minorities such as the black American, who have fought so hard for their place in this country, being held back again with a holiday Juneteenth, and which many black Americans reject, but now is a national holiday. If you want racism to stop, stop talking about it. Two people have said that before that was Morgan Freeman, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..

29) scandals and unchecked groups who have influences within our state government, showing people being protected such as that of Puff Daddy, who was found to beat his wife and girlfriend at the time, but was a huge proponent for Joe Biden, and his coalition.

30) hundred percent dismantling of our military, literally our military is just a showpiece. It has been weakened greatly in the last four years.  

31) most of America oil reserves, which was well over a few billion dollars of those reserves for either high emergencies and or wartime, have been 95% depleted by the Biden administration to basically ease. America‚Äôs worries about the gas prices increasing. The biggest depletion of these reserves was in the summer of 2022 and 2023 when gas prices started to increase rapidly, the Biden administration injected these reserves to ease the panic of the American people. Rather than being honest and telling the truth, put on a fa√ßade as if the gas prices were declining just for those same prices to shoot up even higher the following months.

32) we have had our countries identity and culture stepped on and totally erased or attempted to be erased from history with petitions on knocking down statues, etc.

Another four years of the above points this will not be a country anymore, but rather it will decline into what we would know as a ‚Äúbanana Republic‚Äú and shortly thereafter would be a fallen state which will leave it open to foreign enemy takeover   we have too many people in this country who do not even like the United States, but are embedded it now and it‚Äôs fabric. Instead of just going elsewhere since they don‚Äôt like it, there are like a germ or a disease that is constantly spreading deter the American platform change needs to happen"	"Ugw_UVVOHgmnrZwJMfl4AaABAg"	"13168"

The Democrats would be very lucky to convince him to withdraw his candidacy for reelection, and the odds of getting him to Retire or Resign before his term is over is basically Zero.

The only way to force the issue is for the Vice President and most of the Presidents Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office for Medical Reasons, in which case VP Kamala Harris becomes the Acting President.

Besides, almost without exception, whenever a political party has NOT nominated a sitting President for a second term and someone else gets the nomination, they invariably lose in the General Election.   That is a historical fact.

As has been pointed out, the Democrats believe that if they don‚Äôt replace President Biden with another nominee that they will lose to Former President Trump in November.  That‚Äôs speculation at this point, but I can understand why they would feel that way.

The problem for Democrats is, is that if they replace President Biden as their nominee then that all but guarantees that the Democrats will lose to Former President Trump in November.

It sounds to me that the Democrats have what‚Äôs sometimes called a no win scenario‚Ä¶ Former President Trump will most likely win the Presidency in November, 2024.

Like Hillary...Trump will hyper motivate the opposition to vote.  However comma also like Hillary (with Dems), there are a enough Republicans who would either vote for Biden or not vote at all before they vote for Trump (TY Lincoln Project & never Trumpers etc).  Fortunately, Biden doesn't carry that Clinton baggage, yet Dems still detest Trump and when he is on the ballot or his ideology is front and center - we show up for the party - evidenced by the unlikely Dem wins/special elections in 2018, 20 & 22 - trust the history.  Dems will ALL come home when Trump is the alternative (and now Biden has a record to run on) whereas Trump has only gotten worse - trust the history.  Unless some of these weak-knee'd Dems have an ulterior motive or agenda...this is easy math.  Dems will come home when the choice is a guy that wants to be a dictator, the supreme court has cleared the way for a dictatorship and Project 2025 is due to destroy democracy as we know it.  Remember I said this.  You're Welcome! 

Bonus nugget.  Trump's max is 47%, he has lost too many people to get any higher.  Biden will win with 50% because there are more of us than them.  We don't need Republicans to win...we just need Dems to continue to show up and we're going to be just fine.  Mr. President, please continue to be yourself and dance with the ones that brought you here or you're going to wind up like Al Gore and John Kerry - being over coached trying to be all things to all people.

The high success of Newton's astronomy was in one way an intellectual

illusion was created by the circumstance that Newton's mechanics had a good
model in the solar system. For this gave the impression that we had here an ideal
of scientific explanation; whereas the truth was, it was mere obligingness on
the part of the solar system, by having had so peaceful a history in recorded
time, to provide such a model. For suppose that some planet had at some
ume erupted with such violence that its shell was propelled rocket-like out of
the solar system. Such an event would not have violated Newton's laws; on
the contrary, it would have illustrated them. But also it would not have heen
calculable as the past and future motions of the planets are presently
calculated on the assumption that they can be treated as the simple 'bodies'

No one got exactly what they wanted with those bills but if Democrats wouldn't have arose to the occasion how many would have starved by now because a minority had a fantasy about being the majority? How many trillions in increased debt load would we have because of an increase in interest rates because our credit rating slipped, would the dollar still be the world currency, and all kinds of other huge questions? I remember Trump and the freedom caucus wanted to just let the bills go unpaid. And there's nothing they can do to make me forget their temper tantrum tactics. The absolute smartest thing GOP could have done is dump Trump but i guess they're not smart enough to figure it out without the pens at the voting booth. I'm sure after watching them as long as i have they'll be shell shocked wondering how it happened. What was it someone said, If you allow criminals to get away with something you have to expect them to increase their game.

He may also be miscalling a number of his keys:  technically, we may not be in a recession, but most people don't feel great about the economy; Trump may not be generationally charismatic, but there's a HUGE gap between his charisma and Biden's.  Strictly speaking, there can be only one incumbent, but since both have track record as president, we effectively have two.  Lastly, actively concealing that Biden has such severe dementia that he may not be able to govern seems like about as big a scandal as one could imagine.

It is not possible to give Harris the benefits of incumbency when she is polling even worse than Biden, the real incumbent.

Gavin Newsom's state is a trainwreck. You can rob a store as long as you steal under $900.00. What kind of ethics and morality is that?  Should thieves bring their calculators when they rob?  So, stores have just shut their doors. Closing down commerce is not a path to success.  Tent cities abound, and homeless people are using the streets as a toilet. Open toilets smell and breed disease. And, illegal fentanyl is not the answer to getting rid of your homeless population. That's also unethical, illegal and immoral. Replacing the middle class who are leaving in droves with illegal immigrants is also not the path to success. 

Shall I can continue?  The governor of Michigan has to chelate all that toxic lead out of the blood and bodies of her disadvantaged population's children caused when their clean water source was diverted to old lead pipes so developers licking their chops could have the land and clean water source that was especially left to this population by a past patron of the city.

The seismologist had done a lot of research trying to predict earthquakes, looking at all sorts of phenomena that people though occurred just before an earthquake.  I don't know how successful he was in finding a set of keys that would by majority vote predict an earthquake (note that Lichtman's keys predict an incumbent party loss if 6 of 13‚Äìa majority‚Äîare unfavorable for the incumbents).  Instead of looking at earthquakes, Lichtman looked at what had happened in presidential elections from 1860 to 1976.  I don't know what else he considered but his keys are the 13 that always preceded an incumbent part loss if 6 were negative for the incumbent party.  Which 6 differed from election to election.  If there was one which always preceded an incumbent party loss, then that's all that would be needed (I don't think there's anything magic in the number 13).  I'm not sure which recent election the keys failed on; I think they predicted a Gore win in 2000, and he did win the popular vote.  OTOH, they predicted Benjamin Harrison's win despite his loss of the popular vote (due to violent suppression of Republican votes in one region of the country where the Democrats got no more electoral votes for 70% or 80% of the vote than they wo8uld have for only 55% or 60%)."

Also- saying Trumps charisma only pertains to a ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù group of people is absurd. He got almost as many votes as Biden in the last election- he did not lose by a ‚Äúlandslide.‚Äù I would not consider that to be a ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù group of people who like him and are fanatics lol.

          years with the strain of being the President of the US.  Hence the VP taking over.   Most people would see this as an¬†
          Admission that Biden is a false candidate.  Hence the probably a LOSS.
C) Harris & Someone else = a higher probability of a Loss.  Since she was the first to be Forced To Drop Out in the 2020 Primaries,
          and has a high unpopularity score.....
D) Someone else as Presidential & Anyone else as VP = A Notable Loss!  Since this would be seen as proof that behind the scenes
         power (aka the machine) prevent a fair 2024 Primary in the Democratic Party.  i.e. The Fix was in & the Emperor is not
         wearing any clothes scenario (after the First Debate).  And if they hold the Second Debate, that has fewer rules to protect

Whether it is Biden doing it covertly or those that are propping Biden calling those shots, pulling the plug on the DNC is the easiest way to be done with the manipulators both directly & indirectly. Then there's the connection of dots. While Joe Biden faces no scandal beyond Hunter Biden's legal scandals. Biden was VPOTUS at the beginning of it all. There is no divorcing the IRS tax evasion from Burisma, Ukraine, the laptop, the Big Guy. Anyone the D's trot out to replace Biden with, really has a monumental task ahead of them, considering the state of the nation. All those economic indicators, recession, employment are a matter of the inflation to where the masses (voters) are paying dearly for the Biden-Harris spin, smoke & mirrors of prosperity. J6 ? The coup of Trump was the sequential progression & combined misfortunes of 2019-2020. Nobody could've been as unfortunate as Trump was as a sitting POTUS. And 2021-present, nobody could be as unfortunate as he masses of American voters. Regardless of Biden or the entirety of the DNC pulling this off, D's & R's have to know it's been going on for effectively & essentially 8 years  to 2016. And internally to the party, back to 2008 when it was Obama vs HRC. We're looking at 16 years of this election manipulation for election interference from not only their 1/2 of the 2 party system, to what we see here in 2024 & going after the other party's candidate. like they have. That's just 1 of many reasons why the D's lose the WH in 2024. Wall Street is doing fine, it's Main Street that's eating the misery."	"Ugz30Y_kuT_6pl6C60t4AaABAg"	"14555"

Besides, Biden's fumble is as much of a result of his success as it was his failure to be adequately rested for the event. The President had been to something like ten events within the last few weeks, four of those being flights to and from Europe. No wonder why Biden was fumbling his words, he was exhausted!

One could argue that maybe the President shouldn't have filled his plate so much knowing what was at stake, but if we're going to allow Trump's looming threat to dictate how the President conducts his business with world leaders, we may as well just hand the Presidency over to that clown now and get it over with."

The same thing they went after Trump for, except Biden did not have the authority to remove them from DC or declassify them. He also had them kept in several very unsecured places where anyone could get a hold of them without anyone knowing they were nissing. Many of these documents were Top Secret like plans to defend Taiwan if China invaded. He treated those documents like they were old newspapers. 
As for Trump, he had the authority to declassify and they were all stored on an Island secured by the Secrete Service. There was a huge difference. The same for the case against hm, it is falling apart and the prosecutor has lied on several occasions about what was in those boxes and they were not secured as many people had gone through those boxes and there is no telling what might have been removed or if things were added. Another thing, if anyone has been through a big move and hired a moving company, you would know that they move fast and pack everything. I've been through several moves in my military service and can tell you that they packed a kitchen trash can full of trash, a baby items carrier with full bottles and more. Trump or the people that were responsible for the transition and moving Trumps stuff out of the White House and Preidence office hired a company to do it. Even with a person watching them they could have packed items that they shouldn't have. And from all reports Trump was working with the Archive people to return items they wanted.

If you were seeing $40 on your grocery store receipts under Trump, and now you're seeing $100 under Biden, that's gonna leave an impression. You might be thinking of other things when polled (assuming you, as a normal person, actually bothered to participate in polls), but in the moment of truth, when you have to actually vote, what comes to mind is not whether one politician slept with a c0rn star, nor whether he exaggerates and makes false accusations against the other guy. What comes to mind is those grocery receipts. At the end of the day, that's what you're thinking of. And maybe you're thinking of Biden's senility and his awful debate performance, but honestly, probably not even that. You're certainly not thinking about the economy in abstract terms, you're thinking of your OWN livelihood. At least if you're a normal person. Maybe you're a terminally online partisan, who are the kinds of people who can afford not to care about their grocery receipts. Frankly, they're mostly the kind of people who don't even buy their own groceries. But that's a tiny minority of voters. The vast majority are thinking about their grocery receipts and other expenses, and here we have an unprecedented race where both candidates have occupied the White House for 4 years, and there's a STARK difference between the cost of living under each of them, resulting in a clear contrast.

The SC made two rulings that massively shift powers in the US, one disabling institutions, the other empowering the presidency beyond approach. A president who already staged a coup is up for reelection now.

Two questions matter now. One is what US institutions are doing about it. The answer is: Nothing. And this is probably the last time this question is being asked.

The other question is what the people are doing about it. The answer is: Voting for or against Trump does not seem to be making much of a difference, because they did that before and the outcome seems to be the same. Biden's term neither saved American Democracy as promised, nor did it convince the crazy half of Americans that Democracy is actually better than a Kleptocracy. Or maybe they think there is no difference.

Democrats had their chance. Biden was not chosen by coincidence. Democrats are just as if not more responsible for what's going to happen next. It was up to Democrats to help the people fix the issues that made Trump possible. They chose not to do the job. Biden's debate performance is not an accident, it shows who the Democrats are.

Seems like they're prioritizing political viability over national security. If Biden is too far gone mentally to run for reelection, he's far too gone to still hold office right now. It's terrifying to see the US leading provoking NATO actions that led to Ukraine as well as now signing the DCA with Finland, especially considering that the US military is led by a Commander in Chief who is indecisive and obviously suffering from severe cognitive decline, while Russia's military is being led by a president who is cunning, strategic, decisive, and still has all of his full mental faculties. When we thought our sanctions would cripple Russia, Putin grew an alliance with countries who enabled Russia to enjoy one of the best current economic growths on the planet. Seems like Putin has remained one step ahead of Biden even since 2021 when Biden began provoking Russia by threatening to include Ukraine in NATO. The simple matter of fact is that Ukraine was never going to join NATO because of nations like Turkey, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary preemptively objecting, but the US kept poking the bear, so to speak, with provocative Russophobic rhetoric.  Now the US is provoking Russia by signing an agreement to move 15 new US military bases along the Finnish/Russian border. NATO is also saber-rattling with talks of expanding into South East Asia. Biden is a war hawk and had always been one during his time in the Senate. He fits in more with warmongering elites like George W. Bush and Barack Obama than he does with military realists like Donald Trump or RFK Jr.  We need to stop hiring sociopathic puppets like Bush, Obama, and Biden who are funded and lobbied to by the war Military Industrial Complex."

Here‚Äôs the plan: Picture this‚ÄîJimmy Carter, yes, the legendary Jimmy Carter, makes a triumphant return to politics in 2028. He‚Äôs older, wiser, and ready to reclaim the Oval Office from the clutches of Republican tyranny.

Imagine the drama of a Carter vs. Trump showdown. It‚Äôs a clash of ideologies, a battle of wits and experience versus bombast and bluster. Carter, with his quiet dignity and unwavering principles, stands tall against Trump‚Äôs Twitter storms and political theater.

And guess what? Carter wins! America rejoices as our oldest president yet proves that age is just a number when you have integrity and vision. But wait, the story gets even better.

Fast forward to 2032. The political landscape is still reeling from Carter‚Äôs historic comeback, and who emerges from the Democratic primaries? None other than Joe Biden, back for round two. He‚Äôs seen it all, done it all, and by now, he‚Äôs a political sage, ready to guide the nation through whatever challenges lie ahead.

Biden, the comeback kid of 2032, defeats whoever the Republicans throw at him. Maybe it‚Äôs Ivanka Trump or a resurrected Ted Cruz‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt matter because Biden‚Äôs experience and empathy win the day. The nation celebrates as Biden takes the oath of office once again, this time with the wisdom of age and the fire of experience.

So, why should Biden step down now? This is just the beginning of a political saga for the ages. The Democrats need Biden to stay the course, to pave the way for Carter‚Äôs return and his own triumphant comeback in the years to come. It‚Äôs destiny, it‚Äôs legacy, it‚Äôs the stuff that American dreams are made of!

Forget stepping down‚ÄîBiden‚Äôs journey is far from over. With Carter in 2028 and Biden in 2032, the Democrats are poised for a political dynasty unlike any other.

"V6"	0.763	0.977	"According to Dr. John Gartner, a retired professor at John‚Äôs Hopkins Medical School, Biden‚Äôs gaffes are well within the normal limits of aging. On the other hand, Trump, whose father died of Alzheimer‚Äôs, is showing signs of real brain damage‚Äînot being old or slow or losing a step, but of severe cognitive deterioration. Trump is spiraling into ‚Äúphonemic paraphasias‚Äù during his rally speeches, which is the substitution of non-words that sound similar and are not normally seen until a patient enters the moderate to severe stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs. For example, beneficiaries became ‚Äúbenefishes,‚Äù missiles became ‚Äúmishiz,‚Äù Christmas became ‚ÄúCrissus,‚Äù and bipartisan became ‚Äúbipars.‚Äù

Please note that major risk factors for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease include advanced age (it typically occurs after age 70) and a family history of the disease.

Dr. Vincent Greenwood, Ph.D., founder of DutyToInform.org and the director of the Washington Center for Cognitive Therapy, conducted scientific research on Trump‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs language. He watched a lot of videos of Trump and Biden from when they were in their prime and recently. He then listed the specific, language-related symptoms from the DSM (the Bible for diagnosing psychiatric health conditions) associated with dementia and the same for normal aging. He counted the number of times he saw instances of each symptom. There were increases in symptoms for both Biden and Trump. Neither had significant symptoms in their prime, and both had a significant increase in symptoms from the recent videos. The big takeaway is that Trump‚Äôs increase showed dementia but not normal age-related symptoms and Biden‚Äôs showed normal age-related symptoms but not dementia.

Experts say Trump frequently speaks word salads, a sign of Alzheimer‚Äôs and other types of dementias. ‚ÄúWord salad‚Äù is a term used in psychiatry with a specific definition: severely disorganized and virtually incomprehensible speech or writing, marked by severe loosening of associations strongly suggestive of schizophrenia. The person‚Äôs associations appear to have little or no logical connection.

The transcript of Trump‚Äôs rally speech in Las Vegas, June 9, 2024, provides a good example of a word salad. In condemning electric motor mandates, he gave an anecdote about a speaking with a man who sold boats, and he mentioned, without explanation, his relationship with MIT (where his uncle taught):

So I said, Let me ask you a question. And he said, Nobody ever asks this question, and it must because of MIT, my relationship to MIT. Very smart. He goes -- I say, What would happen if the boat sank from its weight and you're in the boat, and you have this tremendously powerful battery, and the battery's now underwater, and there's a shark that's approximately 10 yards over there?

Elementary School? They predicted every election winner since 1968. We would hear about them every election cycle. But they predicted Hillary Clinton in 2016, and we haven't heard from them since. 

This reminds me of the old mail scheme, you send out 1000 letters predicting who will win a football game. 500 for each team to win. 50% will be right. Now send those 50% another prediction on particular stocks which will go up and down. Take the names of those who received the correct predictions, and so on. Eventually you may have eight or ten people on your list for whom all your predictions came true. They now put full faith in you as if you know what you're doing. Watch the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode Mail Order Prophet.  1957.

It also is funny to me that Biden can lose the incumbency key by dropping out yet he still needs to lose other keys in order not to win the election? Think how many other people in the United States have predicted just as many outcomes as this gentleman simply by making a guess with their opinions. He adjusts the keys based on what's going on at the time if it fits his narrative of a prediction. Last time I heard him say the key for social unrest has not been met for Biden. I can't think of a time in history when it's been worse!  And whether there is a scandal going on? Hunter Biden and money from China - I would say so. 

I wish this gentleman well but there's nothing to it other than a steak of luck. After all, a streak of picking 50/50 outcomes is not that unusual."	"Ugxibd_BjJ3AyVfJfkl4AaABAg"	"15421"

1. Overfitting: By adjusting his points to fit past election outcomes, he is overfitting his model to the historical data. This means that his model may be too specific to the elections he used to create it and may not be generalizable to future elections with different candidates, issues, and contexts.
2. Confirmation bias: His choice of points may reflect his own biases or preconceptions about what factors are important in elections, rather than being based on objective data or research. This could lead him to overweight or ignore certain factors that may be important in predicting future election outcomes.
3. Limited scope: Elections are complex and multifaceted events, and reducing them to a simple set of yes/no points may not capture all the relevant factors or nuances that could influence the outcome. This could lead to oversimplification and inaccurate predictions.
4. Lack of validation: Without testing his model on a separate dataset or using cross-validation techniques, it's impossible to know how well his model will perform in predicting future elections. Simply adjusting his points to fit past outcomes does not guarantee that his model will be accurate in the future.

Overall, while this approach may seem appealing, it is unlikely to produce reliable or accurate predictions for future elections without additional validation and refinement.

All the Democrats wringing their hands over Biden's debate performance need to be willing to listen to his subsequent rally speeches and his phenomenal NATO speech. Furthermore, audio/video experts are saying that CNN manipulated Biden's audio and video. Consider that Republicans/Maga as well as Putin are working feverishly behind the scenes to undermine Biden by whatever means possible. Furthermore, every major media outlet NBC, ABC,CBS, CNN, FOX, etc are Trump donors owned by billionaires who benefit from Trump winning. I am so upset that some Democrats have been so gullible and ready to dump Biden especially considering the fact that other presidents have flubbed their debates at least once. COME ON!!!

I typically enjoy your opinions and learn from your insights, Vann.
Yet I can't even stand to turn on CNN right now, and after seeing your editorial video on the CNN app really makes stomach turn to see how you are using your platform for such destruction. 
You l are not being fair and balanced with you incessant criticism  of Joe Biden because of one bad debate.  Rarely reminding your audience that Biden has a proven record of effectiveness at saving America from utter collapse as a result of the pandemic that Trump ignored and made significantly worse because of his many months delay in taking action.  Jakari took the high ground and told the American people exactly what they needed to know and the Democrat... Have your collective meltdown over the weekend and then move on to the task at hand which is winning this election and saving our democracy. 
They are both old That is not new news. 
They're both not as sharp as they once were. 
And Biden's stutter and stiff walking disease makes him seem even older than he is. 
 Instead of pounding into Americans their fear and dissatisfaction with the economy, Tell the truth and share the hope of what his historic BIPARTISAN legislation to rebuild our infrastructure, bring back high tech manufacturing into the United States, and provide new economic growth opportunities for small and large businesses.... And by the way the best boost for people of color and diverse business owners with the historic influx of 13 billion dollars into the economy to help that particular sector participate in the new economy that he is building through the America Seed Fund.
You will gladly criticize his handling of the Afghanistan departure even though he did not create the timeline or the mandate to leave....  Prior presidents never made an action plan to disengage from Afghanistan and Trump put the deadline in place to extract.  Likewise with the Iran nuclear war agreement that Trump ended and created this situation where we are now potentially at war with Iran. Yet even though our relationship with our allies were pushed to the limits under Trump's insults and reversal of long-term accords, Biden's singular influence with renewing that alliance and stopping the destructive attacks by Russia and a world war, by regaining the trust of our allies as President of the United States and establishing the US as a strong and forceful leader on the world stage.  And while you're at it, look at the difference between the indictments of cabinet members and White House staff between the former president and the current president.
And you and the other talking heads fail to mention the 300 some odd lies that Trump told during the debate. 
And that the American people are poised to elect a convicted felon, sexual predator, convicted fraudster, and an insurrectionist WHO will implement the Project 2025 and forever change the power of the Supreme Court to roll back every precedent of human rights and environmental protection We have fought for 40 years to implement in our courts,, and all the checks and balances of a three branches of government, if they choose to not vote for Biden, or vote for a third party candidate.  Do you really want to be the voice that influenced many Americans to not vote because they feel good about their double hating of the candidates?  Do you really want to be the voice of black Americans to vote against their own personal interest because you feel you can get more clicks and more ratings by being critical of the sitting president? There is an element of the American population that will forever continue to be influenced by the propaganda that Fox puts out. 
Is very disheartening to see CNN, and YOU, wants a seeker of truth and transparency in government, now trying to go after that same audience rather than the intelligent independent voter wanting to elect the best candidate to do the job of the American people.  
Quit trying to think you're going to get more ratings by criticizing Biden. 
It's old. It's offensive. And it works against our efforts to save our democracy and that should be your calling... 
You don't need to manipulate the truth and inflame the fears of Americans about Biden's competence. You need to be fair and balanced about the clear choice that American voters will have and the importance of getting out to vote and voting for Biden... It's not a Democrat versus Republican issue anymore...

"V4"	0.56	0.968	"In All honesty, the Democratic Party can be their own worst enemy. Diversity in thoughts and opinions is a beautiful concept, but failing to rally, fully support, and fall in line is a significant area for improvement. To the credit of the Republican Party, they know how to hold the fort down and support their leadership, both rank and file. For example, if Former President Donald Trump had passed out during the debate, there would have been no one in the Republican Party asking him to step down because they recognized he was their strongest candidate. On the other hand, in the Democratic Party, there is a lot of noise about their elected candidate, President Joe Biden. Yes, President Biden had an awful debate for whatever reason, but calling for him to step down is highly unwarranted and unwise. In examining potential Democratic Party front runners, who are qualified to replace him? I keep hearing talks about Governors Gavin Newsome (CA) and Gretchen Whitmore (MI), but they need national recognition or experience. They may be prevalent in their home states but have yet to be tested nationally. Given the stakes of this election, it is unlikely they will be a force against Former President Trump.
Additionally, media outlets like CNN say House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would be a good choice again. He does not have the experience or national recognition and is still getting his footing in his current leadership role. Lastly, there are news media outlets (not the people) pushing for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the presidential candidate. Still, I strongly dissent, given her record and historically low approval ratings. Vice President Harris has not been able to accomplish anything noteworthy since being in office. Sidebar: I understand Vice Presidents are like spears until something happens to a sitting President. However, she was given tasks like managing and co-coordinating immigration issues at the U.S. Southern Border and has fumbled. Given the Republican Party takes most of the blame for their failure to pass the bi-partisan immigration reform bill (at the behest of Donald Trump). As a Black/African American, it pains me to say that Kamala Harris also faces significant challenges as a mixed-race person. We recognize that racism is alive and well in the United States, including the Democratic Party, as well. Along with being a person of color, she is a woman running for office in a highly contested election; given the historic precedence with women like Shirley Chislom and Hilary Clinton, we are in a more divisive and radical climate."

He also, he and Trump were not allowed to use pre-written notes during the debate so he was on his own thus lost and confused. That's also why he appeared to be staring into space and often didn't look into the camera. He just simply is not capable of doing this job on his own without the puppet masters and script writers. His wife and party know this well. They need to realize that the scam has been exposed and ALLOW him to step down. That's  why they rambling now...because they were not able to hide it from the world any longer and now need a replacement  QUICK. This behavior is nothing new.

Abby Phillip including those many progressive media icons should  objectively critique the media company CNN. Joe Biden's performance may be below our expectations, as we all go through those 'bad days' it is undeniable that Biden had to debate within the poor CNN program format without any fact checking system in the debate. This is a gross negligence on the part of CNN in today's modern media's capability to instantly fact check with technology with AI capabilities.  So media pundits, stop blaming Biden, for your lack of sincerety in pointing out the true problem of not being able to point out the lies of the felon Donald Trump and  how CNN has designed such a horrible and  peculiar program format for the debate.

Why not talk about Biden's success, which are facts and all the lies and misinformation of Donald Trump during the debate. Why not point out the number of lies and so many questions that Donald Trump completely evaded and, at times, shamelessly did not even care to address.

 I guess the new benchmark at CNN is how good of a reality show performer and a liar is the new presidential debate criteria now? Shallow and sensational reality show performance is not professional journalism!

Get real, be professional in journalism.

Dear Ms. Yoffe,

I read your piece in The Free Press on President Biden‚Äôs obvious neurologic illness.

Neurologists frequently make diagnoses by observation. In fact, most movement disorder diagnoses are made by direct observation or description by patients and families. Mr. Biden has Parkinsonism, an umbrella term that refers to neurologic conditions that cause slowed movements, rigidity, and tremors. By observation, he has a masked face, reduced blinking, stiff and slow gait, hunched posture, low volume voice, imbalance, freezing, mild cognitive disturbance, and difficulty turning. I have seen one video of tremor. All these diagnose Parkinsonism. He would need further investigation by experts to determine which specific disease within the broad term he has, such as idiopathic Parkinson‚Äôs disease or another specific disease.

While there is no cure for the many conditions comprising Parkinsonism, there are effective treatments for many of the symptoms. By failing to get a diagnosis, the president is denying himself such treatments, and so worsens his own situation."	"Ugw00Wk6o9otOjLYzaN4AaABAg"	"15738"

You heard what she said?
That Trump wants to change the institution of democracy in America and that they won't let  democracy die in America!

Let me tell you what exactly she was saying: THAT THE DEMS (democrats) in America had built a strong and false institution in America to be in Power perpetually. And now Trump is trying to change and break that institution, AND FOR THAT SINGULAR REASON TRUMP WON'T BE ALLOWED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. In other words, whether or not Joe Biden is old and could perform, he should be allowed to be their.

My advice! Americans don't allow what's going on in Nigeria to happen in your country! If someone is old and not performing pls vote him out of office! American presidency is not for the Dems alone. If they can't give you a better person, then you had no choice than to vote for competency. ON ONE AMERICA WE STAND! THANKS!"	"UgyoSK8QVG32aj20aut4AaABAg"	"15999"

As Obama's VP, Biden's 50 year career has always bridged the mainstream liberals with the black voting block. What's not being discussed is how blurred these and all demographic groups are blurred. Even the 3 plus year harangue of January Sixth and MAGA Republicans has done little. Truth is many black voters do not share the Trump ideology but understand the maga anger and do not see them as a threat. No Kamala or Gavin or Gretchen can change the demographics. In spite of all of the Trump hate, the Trump genius is that he understands how sick the people are of media narratives, bigotry against evangelicals, abandonment of traditional morality plus promotion of non-traditional moralty.

Trump tried to overthrow the government and stole classified documents and you people have the gall to talk about Biden‚Äôs performance during a debate.
Do you really know what‚Äôs at stake for this country? Do you really understand or are tv ratings  more critical than the existence of this democracy?
When Hillary Clinton was running the whole frigging media could only talk about her emails - remember The NY Times - every single day, it was about her emails - that‚Äôs how we got Donald Trump. Now, it‚Äôs about Biden‚Äôs debate.
This president has done so much for this country in spite of the wicked MAGA republicans and this is the thanks he gets. 
Anyone could die anytime - life doesn‚Äôt give any of us a guarantee. Stop spewing crap because you people know better. The presidency is run by a whole bunch of people and if Joe Biden cannot function, America would continue being a democracy because not one person in the Democratic Party has said they are going to be a dictator and seek revenge on their political enemies and their citizens - Not one.
But if you guys want a dictatorship and facism- continue pushing your talking points.
Just take a look at the oligarchs and right hand men from Russia - how many have been poisoned and thrown from buildings - how many are in jail and hiding and thank God for the media - do you see how free they are?

Being born in the last three months of the Boomer generation, I never saw my generation drafted, where all able-bodied men were sent to war. I have enjoyed the freedoms that the generations before me provided. We owe that same freedom to our future generations. We owe them the same liberties we have enjoyed.
Today‚Äôs political powers are corrupt and greedy for both money and control. Our freedom, our Constitution, and our Country are all at risk, like never before. Previous generations understood the importance of our rights and the value of protecting what is dear to us. We have become complacent, losing touch with the reality that not everyone wants us to have peace, prosperity, and happiness. Some advocate for ideas that are just different forms of communism and socialism. These ideas have been tried many times and have always failed. Once power is relinquished to a dictator, it is never returned. You become a disposable asset, and your life is no longer of value to them.
What kind of country do you want to leave your children, your grandchildren, and their grandchildren? Are you aware? Do you see the writing on the wall? Do you know what those in power are doing right now? Don‚Äôt we owe future generations the same inherent rights and freedoms that we were given? Aren‚Äôt they worth it? What excuse will you give them for not fulfilling your patriotic and civic duty?
Now is the time we must stand united. Now is the time we must protect what was always protected for us. It is our duty to provide for and to protect our future generations.
Vote red, or our country is dead. Look how they have gone after Trump, accusing him of things they have already done. Ask yourself why? This is bigger than political parties; this involves deep state and foreign operatives trying to destroy our country. They can‚Äôt buy him off or make him do their evil deeds, so he stands in their way and between us and them. They must eliminate him at all costs.
Never have we seen this level of corruption, and never have our freedoms been more at stake. From one patriot to another, I ask you to do the right thing, fulfill your civic and patriotic duty, and stand between them and our future generations to protect our country and our freedoms.

NEWS FLASH! Democracy has been undermined by democrats for years, and the America we once knew IS gone. So called progressives are bent on changing America constantly.

Remember 2006? One of the hottest items being voted on at that time was gay marriage. The states overwhelmingly voted to define marriage as being between one man and one woman. 
So how did it become legal? Answer: back door legislation, on a federal level. 

That's just one example of a failing democracy. 
Follow the domino effect of that one example. 
Our society has become morally unhinged. 
Does anyone believe those events are unrelated? If so, y'all need to study sociology and human behavior. 
When a moral restraint is removed, curious and unprincipled people will test the boundaries further. That's what's happened. 


Now another issue. People think that Trump is going to reign as some sort of dictator. That's incredibly ironic, considering the kangaroo court attempts to prevent our democracy from having the option of voting for him. 

Can anyone name the supposed 34 felonies? 
That entire trial was a sham. 
If you think I'm wrong, can you explain why a man who's already been convicted of 34 felonies is being allowed to walk around?
Are you aware that the judge who presided over that case took a demotion so he could be the judge presiding over it? 
Are you aware that the judge has set a separate sentencing hearing on July 11th? 
Are you aware that the Republican National Convention takes place July 15-18, and that they have not yet named Donald Trump as the official Republican presidential candidate?

I want a president who really is going to put the Americans and Citizens First. And send back the illegals bc a whole lot of mess has been going on since they've come to the U.S.  also build the wall don't let them in just like that.
And help all Americans and Citizens get all they need. Like Good health care and stop with the copay, get good housing, for all but well organized too. Make Apt. Building strong where neighbors don't hear other neighbors üôÑ STOP MAKING WEAK APT. BUILDINGS it's annoying. Then also make Apt. Buildings be specific for the life style of tenants, have non smokers live in a separate apt. Building, and the smoker's of cigarettes and weed live in a separate apt. Building, and take out homeless out the street and have them live in a transition building but of course those  transition buildings are to be kept well with  maintenance and good security. And those who have mental issues to put in a psychiatric hospital and so on

And I need a president that is going to help the seniors right now help them with getting higher pay social security. They need help paying for home and everything too. They also need help with making moving easy, they need ppl that can help them pack, getting a company that help seniors move, and stop charging crazy overpriced rental for the senior's it's ridiculous half of them not getting much from social it's ridiculous. This need to get fixed that way it well also be a smooth transition for when the young turn Old too, ppl not thinking about the future how it going to be when they become an elder smh.
Also have a program for ppl to get cars, especially if they live in States where transportation is not their strength, meaning there's isn't many transportation.

 I really want a president that is willing to help all Americans of all colors. Uplift America bc all eyes are on America we should be having the best things 1st.

Every journalist has weighed in on it, and it's pretty much what my take was too. Yet today we saw a revitalised Biden, and I'd swear he was a new man.

I watched Ben Maisalis's (Meidastouch) podcast of today, and agreed 100% with what he was saying. Joe is better left to his own devices. He did super well today, in fact he was back to his SOU speech standard. It was obvious that over-preparation and handling by others does not suit Joe, nor would it suit me.

Now that I've had time to reflect on what went down yesterday, I have made the following observations:

1) Biden's mic was quite obviously turned down. I might be in NZ but there's not that sort of attenuation through the ether!!!

2) Recall how many were saying Trump might not turn up? Well he did and he seemed confident from the get go. Why? Then during the debate upon being given the new question he reverted back to lay down the law on Biden and was never stopped. Call me a conspiracy theorist but my guess is Trump has insiders within CNN. I'm certain of this. A professional broadcasting company does not stuff up the sound, and has lame adjudicators.

AIPAC provides illegal foreign influence in US elections and pours millions USD of israeli zionists' money to make sure that only the israeli approved candidates get nominated. That way, USA voters can only choose between people approved by israel, a foreign country, without any dissenting voice.
Too many get USA money but swear fealthy to israel, being elected in top USA positions through AIPAC and israeli support. 
Whoever wins the White House, USA are controlled and owned by israel. No candidate will be elected without israeli zionists' money and AIPAC's foreign influence. USA are lost and USA citizens are puppets to be used, sacrificed and trashed at israel's whim. Just look at what happened to Dem Jamaal Bowman; he was ousted from Congress due to AIPAC israeli money, giving tens of millions USD to another Dem israeli candidate and pouring millions USD into a campaign against Bowman."

Professor Allan Lichtman has a model of 13 keys that he uses to predict presidential elections.  He has predicted at least 9 of the last 10 presidential elections correctly using this model (10 out of the last 10 if you think Bush vs Gore was stolen, as Professor Lichtman does).  According to his model, debates don't matter in presidential races.  Being an incumbent running for reelection, however does matter.  This is one of the keys.

I'm tired of these weak hosts who behave   like buffoons and don't push back when blatant lies are being told by Trump. Isn't CNN responsible for monitoring the debate and pushing back when he's spreading blatant misinformation. The man is a pathological liar so CNN failed to prepared for this debate by having people to check the validity of what was being said. CNN just isn't a good source anymore. I mean they really suckfor failing to do their job. Why bother holding a debate if they're stopping short of verifying what's true and what's false? The public doesn't appreciate this serious breach of trust by CNN. So thanks to the inadequacy of CNN there are people in this country that never heard any pushback on all the misinformation Trump spewed. Those people are now repeating what they heard to their friends and family and the lies will continue to be spread around as truth when it is.  The media fails miserably as a rule. I grew up during a time when the news covered so much more than it does today. The propaganda and the fluff that's served up to voters in this country is getting worse.  It is the responsibility of the mass media to educate the public not sit back and allow Trump, a well known pathological liar, to yap away lying everytime he opened his mouth. Biden did great at his rally in North Caroline after the Presidential debate. Trump had a rally which fell flat and as usual Trump rambled on about Silence of the Lambs. He's embarrassing himself.

Trump‚Äôs charitable Foundation was found fraudulent ( they used charitable donations for personal use) and State of NY shut them down and forced whole family out of those positions for 10 years. 
And his supporters supported him. He was found guilty of sexual assault, and his supporters rallied around him. His business was found guilty of business fraud, and they rallied around him again. 
Then he was found guilty of 34 felonies, and his supporters rallied, defended, and sent
 him $$. Again. 
Joe had a bad debate, and the Democrats and many of his supporters are panicking and running away like rats from a sinking ship. 
Reagan had a debate where he didn‚Äôt even make sense, supporters rallied around, he was fine at next debate and won 4 more years as president. His party appreciated his accomplishments and stuck with him. 
Trump says all sorts of crazy shit at his ralleys, and they still support him, every time.

As an idiom, use of the story's title refers to something widely accepted as true or professed as being praiseworthy, due to an unwillingness of the general population to criticize it or be seen as going against popular opinion. The phrase emperor's new clothes has become an idiom about logical fallacies. The story may be explained by pluralistic ignorance. The story is about a situation where no one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes. Or alternatively, everyone is ignorant to whether the emperor has clothes on or not, but believes that everyone else is not ignorant.

They do not represent working class Americans but special interest groups that would rather undermine and support the enemies of America and the enemies of America‚Äôs allies .

What Is a Late Termination of Pregnancy, and When Is It Legal?
Late-term abortion refers to any abortion performed after the first trimester. This is a colloquial rather than a medical term.
In most areas, exceptions allow for abortions until birth, such as rape, incest, and the mother's health.
Late-term abortions require methods other than those used within the first 12 weeks.
üìñ This article provides information on late-term abortions (e.g., gestational limits and abortion methods).

Overview
What Are Late-Term Abortions, and How Far Along in Pregnancy Can You Have One?
A late-term abortion is understood as a termination of pregnancy performed after the first trimester (i.e., after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). According to CDC's Abortion Surveillance 2021 statistics, 6.6% of US abortions are performed after week 13. Theoretically, abortions are possible up until birth. A distinction is usually made between:
Second-trimester abortions, ending at viability* at around 24 weeks,
And third-trimester abortions, starting around week 25.
*Viability is the stage at which survival outside the womb is possible.
When Is It Legal to Have a Late-Term Abortion?
If you live in an area with a threshold restriction for late-term abortions, specific reasons must be provided that allow for an exception.
Conditions for Late-Term Abortions
If a doctor deems an abortion necessary to save the mother's life, abortion is permitted in most countries, even where abortion is illegal. Other indications that may allow for a late abortion are socioeconomic, the health of the mother, fetal anomalies, rape, or incest.
This table provides you with information on late-term abortion exceptions in your region. The numbers indicate the time limit for abortion in weeks of gestation, counting from your last menstrual period (LMP), according to the specific reason provided.

His drugs were better balanced vs. the SOTU address.  And yet, he exposed. his dementia to everyone - or I should say to the Liberals that were in denial and the liberal media that were conspiring with the administration to hide the situation. How can you trust ANYTHING CNN says?

 The real issue is that the media, like CNN and government officials like the press secretary have been lying to the American people.  It was obvious to me and other conservatives who have been watching things unfold we KNEW Biden was deep into dementia.  I guarantee that CNN and the other Liberal moutpieces and co-conspirators propogated the lie.  

Don't misunderstand, I LOVE Biden as the Democrat candidate because he will help expose and drag down the left wing democrat party.

The existing Democrat Party is a clear and present danger to our country and its democratic principles.  Generally, when they blame things on conservatives it is because they are already doing it.  Lawfare, politicizing the Justice Department, politicizing the FBI and CIA, THAT IS undermining democracy.

Trump did NOT attack Joe Biden personally (probably because it was obvious that Biden was doing a great job looking incompetent and didn't need any help).  Trump did in fact answer every question but he wisely used his time first to rebut Biden's statements and lies, but did in fact answer the questions. Just because CNN wanted to dwell on January 6th and make it sound like Trump wouldn't respect an honest and fair election doesn't mean that Trump has to play along with CNN.  In contrast, Biden wasn't cogent enough to know he was lying."	"Ugxfq4Spt-o8edZuo_14AaABAg"	"18144"

I also want to know, as someone who holds a clearance, why Biden has not been jailed for breaking national security ? - Any military personnel that breaks national security would have been thrown in Leavenworth for the duration of their life. So when he says  Nobody is above the law... does that mean he is nobody? and the rest of us are somebody? this goes quite deeper than just convicting Donald Trump. The fact that Biden, Hilary, and many other political figures walk free after the things they have done is a slap in the face to every law abiding citizen of the United States, not just the military.

Also, as a Veteran, yes, I hate you, Joe Biden..... You opened the boarder, allowed dozens of illegal immigrants to flood our nation without any type of back round check AND provided benefits that took money out of our pockets. You allowed the VA to use resources for healthcare for the illegal immigrants  which took away from all the veterans filing claims that cant even work to support their families. YOU dont give 2 shits about us. Its always been about money laundering from whatever country you can get your hands on. Not only did you open the boarder, but then proceeded to threaten the national guard with arrests if they didnt stand down. Now, closer to the election you want to act like your doing something just to get votes. During the Afghan pull out, you killed some of my brothers and sisters in arms. Multiple times throughout your presidency, you allowed my brothers and sisters in arms to become hostages, while barely doing anything about it. NOT TO MENTION, the civilian hostages that have been over seas since Oct.7. What a royal POS. And to top it off, using your son to worm your way out of looking like a POS. His service, has nothing to do with your dis-service to this country. His service does not make you great
Let us all not forget about the free crack pipes Joe Biden gave out. I suppose that was his answer to helping addiction. Or how about how his administration censored social media time after time with fake fact checkers.

In fact, the male wins every age class: Baby boys die more often than baby girls; little boys die more often than little girls; teenage boys; young men; middle-aged men. De@th champions across the board. Now it seems that early de@th isn't enough for us‚Äîwe're on track instead to void the species entirely. Last summer a group of researchers from Hebrew University and Mount Sinai medical school published a study showing that sperm counts in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and New Zealand have fallen by more than 50 percent over the past four decades. (They judged data from the rest of the world to be insufficient to draw conclusions from, but there are studies suggesting that the trend could be worldwide.)

"V3"	0.625	0.934	"*Paragraph 3of5.*   *Sperm Count Zero* North American Men's Sperm Count_ The Hebrew University/Mount Sinai paper was a meta-analysis by a team of epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers that culled data from 185 studies, which examined s*men from almost 43,000 men. *It showed that the human race is apparently on a trend line toward becoming unable to reproduce itself.* Sperm counts went from 99 million sperm per milliliter of s*men in 1973 to 47 million per milliliter in 2011, and the decline has been accelerating. Would 40 more years‚Äîor fewer‚Äîbring us all the way to zero? I called Shanna H. Swan, a reproductive epidemiologist at Mount Sinai and one of the lead authors of the study, to ask if there was any good news hiding behind those brutal numbers. Were we really at risk of extinction? She failed to comfort me. ‚ÄúThe What Does It Mean question means extrapolating beyond your data,‚Äù Swan said, ‚Äúwhich is always a tricky thing. But you can ask, ‚ÄòWhat does it take? When is a species in danger? When is a species threatened?‚Äô
And we are definitely on that path.‚Äù That path, in its darkest reaches, leads to no more naturally conceived babies and potentially to no babies at all‚Äîand the final generation of humans will roam the earth knowing they will be the last of their kind. 
    If we are half as fertile as the generation before us, why haven't we noticed? One answer is that there is a lot of redundancy built into reproduction: You don't need 200 million sperm to fertilize an egg, but that's how many the average man might devote to the job.
     Most men can still conceive a child naturally with a depressed sperm count, and those who can't have a booming fertility-treatment industry ready to help them. And though lower sperm counts probably have led to a small decrease in the number of children being conceived, that decline has been masked by sociological changes driving birth rates down even faster: People in the developed world are choosing to have fewer children, and they are having them later."

Swan herself had conducted smaller studies on declining sperm counts, but in 2015 she decided it was time for a definitive answer.

The results, when they came in, were clear. Not only were sperm counts per milliliter of s*men down by more than 50 percent since 1973, but total sperm counts were down by almost 60 percent: We are producing less s*men, and that s*men has fewer sperm cells in it. This time around, even scientists who had been skeptical of past analyses had to admit that the study was all but unassailable.

But he couldn't argue when the team ran the numbers again and again. The downward slope was unwavering.* Almost all the scientists I talked to stressed that not only were low sperm counts alarming for what they said about the reproductive future of the species‚Äîthey were also a warning of a much larger set of health problems facing men. In this view, sperm production is a canary in the coal mine of male bodies: We know, for instance, that men with poor s*men quality have a higher mortality rate and are more likely to have diabetes, c@ncer, and cardiovascular disease than fertile men. Testosterone levels have also dropped precipitously, with effects beginning in utero and extending into adulthood. One of the most significant markers of an organism's $ex is something called anogenital distance (AGD)‚Äîthe measurement between the @nus and the genit@ls. Male AGD is typically twice the length of female, a much more dramatic difference than height or weight or musculature. Lower testosterone leads to a shorter AGD, and a measurement lower than the median correlates to a man being seven times as likely to be subfertile and gives him a greater likelihood of having undescended test!cles, testicular tum0rs, and a smaller pen!$. ‚ÄúWhat you are seeing in a number of systems, other developmental systems, is that the s*x differences are shrinking,‚Äù *Swan told me.

They also said the rate of decline is not slowing. Both findings -- in a meta-analysis bringing together various studies -- pointed to a potential decline in male health and fertility.

Daniel Brison, a specialist in embryology and stem cell biology at Britain's Manchester University, said the findings had major implications not just for fertility but for male health and wider public health. An unanswered question is whether the impact of whatever is causing declining sperm counts will be seen in future generations of children via epigenetic (gene modifications) or other mechanisms operating in sperm, he said in an emailed comment.

When the young demonstrators held their resolve, they were beaten with wooden handles that had not yet had metal ax heads attached. While the violence was first aimed at the lunch counter demonstrators, it quickly escalated to include any African American in sight of the white mob. Police stood idly by watching the beatings until members of a Black street gang called ‚ÄúThe Boomerangs‚Äù attempted to protect those being attacked.

That's because a slew of science textbooks submitted to the state Board of Education (BOE) were rejected last week, as the Republican-dominated body moves to curtail education materials deemed too one-sided on climate change. Many of the rejected books taught that humans are negatively impacting the environment. And the scare tactics that come with that, that is my main issue, Evelyn Brooks, a Republican board member, told _AFP._ She claimed, counter to scientists and the federal government, that the science is not settled on global warming. America's decentralized education system leaves curriculum management mostly up to individual states, with local school districts also having a degree of autonomy. 
      The news articles that follow prove that the extinction by the year 2060 runaway-AGW that -America- *Republicabortions are causing.* Creates the *climate-refugees* and homelessness within -America- AmurderKKKguna, *at the southern border,* _and all over the planet._ *QMAGAt-Fascists who read My comments can no longer fool themselves into believing that extinction by the year 2060 due to runaway-AGW; is a hoax.*"	"UgyJBxWC7MTy3X5W1Qd4AaABAg"	"19408"
"V1"	0.482	1	"P2  _Texas Republicans climate in textbooks_  That has led to fraught battles across the country as each jurisdiction debates how to teach climate change and other politically charged issues, such as racism and sexuality. It also leaves room for officials like Brooks in Texas, which produces 42 percent of the nation's crude oil, to push back against the political ideology of climate change -- a concept she considers a blatant lie. - Increasingly polarized - Science textbooks from publisher _Green Ninja_ were among those voted down by the Texas BOE. *It was because of our inclusion of climate change,* director Eugene Cordero told AFP in an email, adding that one board member took particular issue with a prompt asking students to create a story warning friends and family about possible future weather and climate extremes. Textbooks from eight of 22 publishers that submitted materials to the board were rejected last week, according to a count from Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), a nonprofit which promotes the teaching of climate change. Some were eventually accepted, after revisions to sections on climate change and evolution -- another controversial subject in the largely Christian Texas. The rejected books are not necessarily banned from classrooms, but using approved books is typically tied to getting government funding. As broiling summers are supercharged by climate change, some fear that students won't see the bigger picture. If kids don't understand what all of that means, and they're just going to continue to perpetuate the problem, said Marisa Perez-Dias, one of five Democratic members of the board. Staci Childs, another Democratic board member, charged that some of her colleagues felt like some of the materials negatively reflected how oil and g@s impacts our society. In a show of just how powerful the industry is in Texas -- even as the state becomes a growing hub for renewables -- two of the 10 Republican members work directly for the sector. Though the state has long been conservative, debate seems to have gotten more polarized recently, Perez-Diaz told _AFP._"	"UgwT9JQxkZ2-WHEzJxx4AaABAg"	"19409"
"V1"	0.521	1	"P3  _RepubliKlans aim @ climate change -- in textbooks_ Where previously a consensus could be met across party lines before, we don't see that as much anymore. - Getting better? - In neighboring Oklahoma, the state's Energy Resources Board -- which is entirely funded by the oil and g@s industry -- has distributed free education materials aligned with the sector's interests, often to underfunded schools. Former governor Mike Huckabee, of neighboring Arkansas, has created a Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change. The monthly series of lessons, available for sale online, promises to counter an agenda on climate change that promotes fear and panic pushed by teachers and the media. Like other conservative complaints about climate change, the guides try to thread a needle -- avoiding outright climate denialism, while at the same time rejecting the leading scientific consensus. Everyone agrees that the Earth's climate is always changing and that industrial development has negatively impacted the environment, the curriculum reads. But that does not mean the planet is doomed, it says. Some very smart people have not been able (to) predict what will happen with the earth. So we really don't know. Earlier this year, the free-market think tank the Heartland Institute sent its own climate change-skeptical book -- which AFP factcheckers found to be misleading -- to 8,000 teachers. Despite the setbacks in Texas, Branch, of the NCSE, says climate change education across the country is generally improving. That's partly because it's starting from a very low level."

But each fraction of a degree of warming gets us closer to catastrophic tipping points, including collapsing ice sheets and melting permafrost, and makes climate disasters like extreme heat and flooding more likely.

   World War I intensified the Great Migration, the mass emigration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrial North and Midwest in hopes of escaping the poverty and discrimination of Jim Crow laws. 
   By the summer of 1919, approximately 500,000 African Americans had resettled in northern cities. In many cases, northern Whites‚Äî *many of them newly arrived immigrants themselves* ‚Äîdid not welcome Black newcomers.

"V1"	0.45	1	"P3    _Red Summer_     When the war ended many returning servicemen resented that their vacated jobs had been taken, particularly by African Americans. Black laborers already suffered from a negative reputation in the White working community for their use as low wage-earning strike breakers, or ‚Äúscabs,‚Äù who would keep factories in operation while the employees went on strike. The situation was made worse in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Many officials and others, with little or no evidence, suspected Black workers of being pawns of Bolsheviks and anarchists. Many Whites feared that the return of tens of thousands of Black veterans, with experience living abroad and, more significantly, having received military training, would be unwilling to resubmit to traditional political and social subjugation in the U.S. Many Black leaders encouraged returning servicemen to assert themselves and fight for the dignity and respect they had earned through their military service. W.E.B. Du Bois famously called upon Black veterans to not simply ‚Äúreturn from fighting‚Äù but to ‚Äúreturn fighting.‚Äù"	"UgxQXKpCup2H3yObHSx4AaABAg"	"19570"

Most violent incidents during _The Red Summer of 1919_ were not initiated by fringe white supremacist terror groups. Ordinary white civilians and veterans, unaffiliated with the Ku Klux Klan or any other racist organization, formed most of the mobs. Many of the dozens of incidents that occurred over the course of the year were made far worse because local, state and federal officials hesitated in taking action or turned a blind eye to the violence. Racial violence broke out in some of the nation‚Äôs most populous cities. A four-day riot in Washington, D.C. began on July 19 when a rumor that Black men had assaulted a white woman incited mobs to attack local Black neighborhoods and assault random African American individuals on the streets."

Yet one legacy of 1919 was the growing confidence and desire to fight back‚Äîin the streets, in the courts and in the voting booth‚Äîfor African American communities across the country. _The Red Summer_ saw Black populations fight back aggressively against racial violence and intimidation in ways that were not typical before. *The Red Summer of 1919* did not intimidate African Americans into submission, as their tormentors had hoped. Instead, African Americans emerged from the violence of that bloody year with a greater sense of shared purpose, identity and pride, which served as a vital foundation for the civil rights movement to come."

Heavy rain, mountain snow, and flooding affected areas in the west. ‚ÄúThere is a need to enhance preparedness for such extreme events and to ensure that we meet the UN target of Early Warnings for All in the next five years,‚Äù said Prof. Taalas. ‚ÄúToday only half of 193 Members have proper early warning services, which leads to much higher economic and human losses. There are also big gaps in basic weather observations in Africa and island states, which has a major negative impact on the quality of weather forecasts.‚Äù"	"UgyOZpL-FmrZP5gZYaJ4AaABAg"	"19637"

How can it be that the twice impeached, convicted felon Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party again? As inexplicable as it is to many of us, I think after eight years we have to accept that almost half the country is beguiled by the man while the other half looks on in abject horror and carry on from there. But as much as we may be dismayed by this adoration and fealty to Trump the man, it's still maddening that so many voters ‚Äî including even Democrats ‚Äî insist that everything was so much better when Donald Trump was president. I can't believe that people have forgotten what it was really like. By almost any measure it was an epic sh**show.

The reality, of course, was far different. From the day after the election, Trump's presidential tenure was a non-stop scandal. Even in the early days of the transition, there were substantial and well-founded charges of corruption, nepotism and collusion with foreign adversaries. There was the early firing of Trump's national security advisor, the subsequent firing of the FBI director and eventually the appointment of a special counsel. He did manage to set a record while in the White House: the highest number of staff and cabinet turnovers in history, 85%. Some were forced out due to their unscrupulous behavior, others quit or were fired after they refused to carry out unethical or illegal orders ordered by the president. This continued throughout the term until the very last days of his presidency when a handful of Cabinet members, including the attorney general, resigned over Trump's Big Lie and refusal to accept his loss. Yes, those were really good times. Let's sign on for another four years of chaos, corruption and criminality. But, let's face facts."	"UgyylwREiyAAfmszXtN4AaABAg"	"19978"

None of that is remotely true. The Trump economy was the tail end of the longest expansion in history begun under President Barack Obama and the low interest rates that went with it. Nothing Trump did added to it and he never lived up to even his own hype: Trump assured the public in 2017 that the U.S. economy with his tax cuts would grow at ‚Äú3%,‚Äù but he added, ‚ÄúI think it could go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6%, ultimately.‚ÄùIf the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation averaged 2.67% under Trump, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Inflation started its rise at the beginning of the pandemic (Trump's last year) and continued to rise sharply in the first year of the Biden administration before it started to come back down. The reasons are complex but the fact that it was lower under Trump is simply a matter of timing. Trump's economy was good but it wasn't great even before the pandemic. He had higher unemployment than we have now, he blew out the deficit with his tax cuts and his tariffs accomplished zilch. Sure, the stock market was roaring but it's even higher now. Unlike Trump, who simply rode an already good economy, Biden started out with the massive crisis Trump left him and managed to dig out from under it in record time. No other country in the world has recovered as quickly and had Trump won re-election there's little evidence in his record that he could have done the same.

With looming worries about jobs, homes and healthcare
College debt, crime, terrorism and disease.
Americans seek clear options this November
As we pray for those we vote for on our knees.

America needs a president who relies on faith and prayer 
One who can lead by example, servitude and more.
Someone who loves our freedom and heroes of the past 
Who inspires us like none we have known before.

Whoever wins the final vote when tallied
We pray they succeed and restore America‚Äôs glory.
The time has come for all of us to rise up and change
As freedom, love and commitment become our story.

If Washington and Lincoln were alive and well
And spoke of America‚Äôs troubles we face today.
I wonder what they might faithfully suggest 
And would we heed to anything they would say?

I believe that regulation kills more US jobs than the cost of labor.  You have to realize that it's not cheap to ship something halfway around the world back to the United States that used to be manufactured here.  I can guarantee that making the same product, the United States is more friendly to the environment than China is, but the regulation placed on business here becomes too much of a liability to companies.  After a certain line is crossed, it's more profitable for a company to have a larger energy usage because of shipping and pollution footprint somewhere else in the world instead of here at home.

There's no question that we were better off with Trump in the White House, yet I thought he missed opportunities in this debate and dwelled too much on the obvious in efforts to hammer some things home.  This was more of a pissing contest than a debate.  I guess you can't argue with the fact that Trump came out on top in this 1-on-1 sling fest, but I couldn't help but wonder what direction it might have taken if an intelligent candidate such as RFK Jr. had also been on stage.  As good of a president Trump was, he did make mistakes -- a couple of which were the same mistakes made by Biden.   Biden has been just plain awful.  At the end of the day, I will probably support Trump, but we deserve to hear from a contender with similar and possibly additional skills and similar beliefs.

Veterans live on the street and they do not get help taking care of themselves despite their disability if they have family taking care of them they do not get help with the  equipment cost no matter how much disability they have because they only count service connected disability.  They do not get paid to stay home and take care of them because the service connected disability is even too hard to get the bar is set way too high. I have seen veterans walking in a walker struggling to get to and inside the grocery store because they have no one taking care of them and they have to eat They do not drive I bet they only get whatever groceries fit in their walker that they are lucky to have.

But the wide open borders are just inexcusably insane. Millions and millions of illegal immigrants costing us billions and billions of dollars with an estimated 10% felons & hardcore felons flooding our country with drug cartel gang members,¬† traffickers of women and children, thieves, gun runners, sex offenders,¬† terrorists,¬† child molesters,¬† drug smugglers,¬† rapists, and murderers. What kind of person or party allows that to happen? I was a Democrat for decades but I can't deny that Trump did a much better job running this country than what we've seen from Biden. It's a rough pill to swallow but honestly Biden gave us nothing he promised while Trump gave us even much more than he promised during his first campaign. Treasury Department facts & figures give proof of that. It is obvious now Biden is not running this country. Whoever it is it's extremely bad everything they're doing and I've lost my trust in the Democratic party. They're taking us to a very dark place. Our current government is seriously corrupted and what we've got to have now is the best man to straighten things out. We all know who's the top man for that job and no matter how else you might feel about him he's one helluva fighter and knows how to win. If you bought into the media's scare tactics of dictatorship and democracy destruction don't let them fool you.¬† Neither will take place. The bogus felonies are just as irrelevant. Trump could be living on an island avoiding everything, but instead he's fighting for all of us. That's not a selfish man. But he's got to win in a landslide or they can cheat the ballots.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.‚Äù

Haily was prominent, but the reality of it with her is that the female president barrier may have gotten her overall. It will happen one day ladies, don't worry about that. I mean Hillary didn't lose that much by Trump back then, so that is a sign. Oh well, personally, I am not looking forward to voting in November. These two are far too experienced in chaos in their own unique ways. If Biden wins, we will  continue on the path of more money problems.
