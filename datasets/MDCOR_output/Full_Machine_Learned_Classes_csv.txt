"V2"	0.471	0.928	"The best is for Biden to stay in the race to be elected president.  To appease the worries about his age,  he should plan to serve only a short time of the 4 years.  He is fine today after 4 years, he should be fine for a little time more. AND IF NOT,  he will be replaced by his vice-president.  He is free to choose who his running mate will be,  and he should choose THE BEST person to replace him, even if this is not the Kamala.  I think that Pete Buttigieg is the best qualified, who will be also THE YOUNGEST,  therefore compensating for Biden's age.  This will guarantee a very important CONTINUITY of the good government we have now, and Biden can give especial importance to coach and pass on his experience and knowledge to Pete.  Then, when Biden retires in a short while, like a year or less, we will have a YOUNG president who continues making progress."	"UgzoBIAROKbyqkXjE6R4AaABAg"	"4"

"V2"	0.847	0.928	"(. . . - - - . . .) After this poor performance by Joe R Biden Jr. In the 2024 Presidential “debate” with former President Donald J. Trump, and now for Biden to have any chance to WIN the 2024 U S. Presidential election, Koe R. Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden's Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November,  to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? All voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr  would be handing the Presidential Office to His history making centrest, and Independent politicaly thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III soon after the 2024 Election 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, “all-ready” to be a calming force often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus  building, Independent President demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken likable human being with excellent communications skills aa United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation’s Leaders to govern, and, most important to heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this task ahead, or the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! Joe Biden……”Time to Man Up”. Make the right choice, at the right time who should better be the Country's Vice President who will make right these United States as the next U.S. President, and to the benifit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should br our best forward facing identity, decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential performance, and our then combined united agreement in such. So as you often say, Joe R. Biden Jr. , “Cut The Malarkey” of having  Kammla Harris as your 2024 Democratic V.P. running mate ! Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by vering away from the Political Polerrzation of today deviding “We the People” with a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III by your side now until November 2024. Why because a centrist moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward (. . . - - - . . .)

Just from the interviews and apparently there are archives stating that they had some fake Trump supporters there trying to get the protesters upset I don’t know who is telling the truth unfortunately because I see what happened to the court proceedings and I know enough about that to know that that was wrong. Justice should prevail by honest and true facts why add to the fire by being dishonest with the court’s regulations and change the law specifically for that conviction if he’s guilty then you try him fairly that is what is so beautiful about this country now that the world saw what was done it only puts a target on there back.

I just feel if one is going to point out someone’s flaws then point out the raw truth don’t add to anything or do anything out of anger or ego or illegally because it doesn’t put the target on Trump. It now unfortunately puts the target on them and that’s what I feel it did by the poles.

This was in 2019 and I remember that soldier saying that Trump has no fear and cares about our country I asked him how he said I could be dead right now. Because the general or something was hesitating on backing the 25 or so soldiers that  where stuck in some type of situation where they knew they were about to be bombed. The general finally said he couldn’t get enough of some team out there in time to protect them well one of the lieutenants had either a connect right to Trump or to Trumps connection and they were able to reach them and right after the received the No from general the air forces came and got them out took out the enemy’s and i don’t have the story for verbatim however it was basically what he said.

Trump has taken advantage of that for his entire life. He declares company bankruptcy and walks out the courthouse each time meaning others have to cover his debts and repeats his ineptitude and does it all again. It's long overdue for private company owners to go to jail for corporate crime and for public company directors to do so as well. Obama should have jailed some bankers back in 2009-10 and his refusal to do that and instead give them taxpayer's cash, is a major factor in why USA has to deal with Trump and MAGA now."

All networks need to show Biden's answers to most questions AGAIN as DT just lies & insults instead of answering ANY questions. Actual dementia doesn't come & go as quickly as his stumbles at the END of long, Factual statements show. But his life long stutter is why he lost track of his clear train of thought. A stutter's brain leaps ahead in it's thoughts & says words out of context. Based on working with special need kids & psychology. But 99% of Biden's answers were clear & on point. While he revealed later the cold he had was severe enough that they tested him for covid & the flu. But the media has crucified Biden for his flubs without ONE WORD on the lies & taunts by DT.

Trump goes of on a tangent talking about things not pertinent to the question, preferring instead, to engage in ad hominem attacks on Biden.

I think the United States would be best served by giving the Biden administration another four years in office, even if it means that the Vice President will have to take over half way through.

Only the market can appropriately set prices to close the mass balance.  Creating jobs is a pointless goal to begin with.   Anyone can create an infinite number of jobs - just have people dig holes and then fill them back in.  If that sounds stupid, then randomly giving tax money yo create new construction jobs should sound exactly the same way because it literally is the same thing.  Giving money to build things that the market doesnt need or want is the same thing as digging holes and filling them back in.  It wastes time and resources that could be used for things that the market (aka the people) actually want or need.  Also, PSA: american citizens pay tariffs, not the countries shipping the goods to us.  Tariffs only increase the price of goods for americans, and prop up businesses that arent competitive to begin with.  If you want to pay more for the same product, go right ahead but dont vote for tariffs that force everyone to do that.  American steel isnt competitive and thats ok - we should take that time and resource and put it to use producing something that is competitive and profitable."	"UgzTmnIRQhd7Gi3o6754AaABAg"	"1039"

As there is no one who can not get saved, if they make the choice to come to God and do so. :[)

1.Realize that all of mankind have sinned before God in one way or another.

Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 
10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
11.There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
12.They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

2.Realize that God loved us enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, by his blood shed on the cross, as a free gift given to us as sinners.

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)
8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
9.Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”

3.Confess unto God to accept this freely given gift of forgiveness, that forgives all sins.

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.”
3.For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”
4.And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
10.For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
13.For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
28.So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

Lastly, here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.
“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. 
I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”"	"Ugw4ROIZWYiFl2BRee54AaABAg"	"1062"

We  can not afford to buy grociers. our mortgages are steadily rising, and our mortgage insurance is out of the box. We can barely afford to live. Why? Because you Biden are making us pay YOU back for all the money you gave out for Covid all the billions you are steadily giving to foreign countries. Our nation is falling. You and the democratic party do not in any way care about the people. You only care about destroying our nation and everything in it. People, if you can not see what has happened, sine Biden came into office,  then please wake up. Trump is correct on the Hispanic taking the jobs, look, around you  paying attention. I feel like I am in another world. Who would have ever thought you would be paying  out the box to try and survive. Biden you do not have to worry because you and the democrats have all the money you need you don't have to worry about where you will live or if you going to eat . My mom told me when I was young when the Republicans are in office everything is good and for the people when the democrats are in office everything falls apart because they are not for the parople and their country. Your own family is not right making you do this when it's obvious that you have Dementia. How sad is this. People do not like Trump because he says it like it is. He speaks the truth. He is in control and he knows business that is very important in someone who is running our country. The thing that is for certain is that Biden open border was to gain all their votes on the upcoming election. That is why they are living better than we are. Honestly it does not matter what color a person is or where they are from we are ALL created by one amazing God. Jesus Christ, he is coming back, and he is the one who will destroy ALL evilness and hatred  in this world. We need to pray for peace and love and happiness. Love and pray for  your enemies.

No, this is due to his incapability to answer the more basic questions. I understand people that hate Donald Trump, but you cannot deny that Biden cannot complete a thought. It is not his fault. This poor old man is beyond his years yet makes some of the largest decisions in history. I am not saying i disagree with his opinions. Some of them are sound, but he struggles at every word and seems to need more and more time to think about each question. Yes he is old as is Trump, but one can quickly reply and one cannot.

     If one of the two debaters is willing to use the tactic of 'gish-galloping' then the gish-galloper, from the standpoint of a troubling number of bystanders watching, will always rhetorically fully win that debate and any debate. 

     The downside to using gish-galloping to gain rhetorical auto-wins in any debate is that the night after fact-checkers finally finish their rundown of all of the in-factualities told during your gish-gallop, you lose an incredible amount of the trust people had in you, for all people that hear and believe what the fact-checkers have to say about your gish-gallop, for all days after that debate.

At the this point it might not make that much difference to those who watched the live version, but if I am correct, it will cause any potential voter that didn't, to question WHY the was a big dea madel about Biden's poor performance, AND, it highlights the type of ongoing mass manipulation and GASLIGHTING that we all are being subjected to by the media.  ???"

This sounds like its the exact thing China wants. If It's cheaper to do business over there, companies will move overseas. That keeps money central to China's economy (or other countries with cheaper taxes) That creates an economy where money flows from the US to foreign entities. Raising taxes won't fix anything. It will do the opposite. It will cause more inflation, prevent us from burning down our deficit, and keep our competitors in business. We need to build up our economy. We need to reward the wealthy because they are the backbone of our economy. Raising taxes won't fix frivolous government spending, it will ENCOURAGE it. We need to SPEND LESS, cut funding from programs that aren't essential and we will be fine. Less spending makes a stronger economy. When businesses have to pay more they raise prices. When they have to pay less, they charge less for their goods and services. This creates an economy that encourages spending and everyone wins. Did this guy forget to take an economics class?"

I kind of want Trump to win honestly even though I disagree with him more. 

My worry is that if Biden is elected A LOT of democrats might switch to being republicans due to how horrible of a leader he is.
Then if Trump is not the lead republican next year we might get someone like Ron Desantis who will destroy our already struggling schools and help create a massively Christian leaning curriculum.

There were no new manufacturing jobs under Trump only low wage jobs, Trump lied about pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord claiming it would cost America money Trump pulled out because Trump had the EPA lift regulations on polluters greedy petroleum companies and coal companies polluted the air and water thanks to Dummy Trump. Trump did NOTHING for Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as far as helping them advance so they can prepare Black students for the corporate world, Trump had former Education Secretary Betsy Du Bois to sucker Black single mothers to enroll their children in loser public charter schools instead of investing in state public schools in Black communities. Trump did NOTHING for Black people they worked two jobs,Trump did NOTHING for veterans there were still veterans sleeping on the streets of Washington DC the VA did not help veterans, Trump's racist immigration policies hurt illegal Hispanic families Trump had children in cages, and parents in holding cells.

"V3"	0.5	0.934	"in Philippians 3.20: For our citizenship is in heaven. If a person's citizenship is in Bolivia, by law he cannot vote in American elections, or for that matter, in any country's elections other than Bolivia's. Even so, a Christian who is a citizen of heaven should not vote in an election of a nation on earth.

II Corinthians 5.20 adds another principle: We are ambassadors for Christ. Paul is specifically speaking of Christian ministers (see Ephesians 6.20), but the principle applies to all Christians, since those Christ has called are to be emissaries for Him before the world (Matthew 5 13-16; Philippians 2 15; II Peter 2 11-12; etc.). If the ambassador from Mozambique were to meddle in the affairs of the United States, even by merely trying to vote, he would be in violation of international law. In the same way, a Christian, an ambassador of Christ's government, cannot interfere in the affairs of another sovereign nation.

Jesus Himself provides a third principle in John 17 16: They [His disciples, Christians] are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. When God calls a person to repentance and conversion, the new Christian is summoned to forsake his former allegiances and throw his hand in with Christ. We see in the apostle Paul that he considered everything before his conversion to be rubbish; his loyalty was fixed entirely with Christ from that point on (Philippians 3 3-11). If an American renounces his citizenship and takes citizenship in another country, he is no longer allowed to vote in American elections—it is not his country. A true Christian must treat his citizenship in the same manner; he is truly not of this world but of the Kingdom of God (Colossians 1 13; see also John 15.19; 18.36; James 4.4; Revelation 18.4)."

√ Hiring Therapists and or Psychiatrists per Precinct with a client/doctor confidentiality, keeping our Officers on the force and maintaining a non-bias, non-mandated reporter-type basis; reprimanding, retraining, not removing;
√ Hiring at least (1) Law Professional per State to mitigate negligible, reoccurring persons and cases to escalate and determine an equitable, fair outcome prior to all-or-nothing offenses occur; to aid, not (necessarily) make life changes or decisions;
√ Mandating CDL-Training (and potentially Hiring Process mitigation) within our Prison System, and a broader-scaled Technical Training within our Jail System;
as well as
√ Hiring, at the very least, a graveyard crew of ~7, per state, maintaining our Country's registry.
These,
I wholeheartedly believe key, when building upon, holding, and in keeping, a career. There should never be despondency; 
if 
there's an issue, should we not be alotted to on-the-job training?
if 
there's emotional turmoil, should we not be alotted on-the-job resources?
if
we're to be hired initially, should we not have job security?
In Every Job Position!

Then there's 
• border protection which is absolutely imperative; 
Key fundamentals of Democratic policies like:
• maintaining Women's Rights (my body, my choice) in her right for an abortion, equality in the workspace, and full equality in general; 
• fighting for our citizens and trying to be the voice for everyone; 
• lowering our deficit;
• focusing on Climate Change in every aspect from Agriculture and Permaculture, to species (on the brink of extinction) rehabilitation and reassimilation, to finding better pesticide and insecticide products that won't harm our critical, benign insects like pollinators and seasonal nomadic; to stopping Any New big Oil and Gas development agreements;
• working with all our World Leaders to create policies best for us, as the United States of America, but also best for our World, globally; 
and
so much more

I would change so much of our marginalized communities, as I can surely stress that it's these citizens who take the brunt, from every level. The disparages of our system can seem unbearable and starting from the bottom, all the way to the top, one step at a time, is how we'll enact a more equitable society. 
But, I'm still too young (VP only!)

We need to come together as the United States of America;
namely,
We all must work; if we've need supplement of our Govt., as Nationals, we must Volunteer at the least, strictly in maintaining our Society. Every one of us United States of America Nationals deserve Housing, a Job, and Financial Aid;
maintaining one designated building in the heart of every downtown, in every City, to supply these needs will promote so much growth in such a rough market that we do currently face.

Building upon our Democratic leadership that I follow in direct cadence, we must:
• focus on Police Reform, Criminal Reform, and in fixing our Mental Health System;
• building upon from the bottom to the top, the middle out, focusing on creating jobs in all sectors in Semiconductors, Food Processing, Manufacturing; and absolutely
• focusing on bad banking practices and in fixing these issues, in predatory lending, triple loans, reliance on Corporations too big to fail; 
then there's even
• Housing Reform:
(1) Deed, per citizen, and or persons with dependents; negotiable, not mandatory; implementations:(1) House, (1) Apartment Complex, (1) Lease, (1) Corporation, (1) Entity, (1) building High-rise; simple! It's clear to see that the Real Estate market is leading our Economy and Society without a single thread of oversight, and it's with shortsighted policies like these that skew, misrepresent, and shatter the current divide of our current American society;
• Immigration Reform:
Process and Deportation with a negotiable Warning or added Criminal charges if the subject is already within the system and these undocumented crossings are continuous;
• Refugee Asylum Reform:
Strict Background Check and applicating process, Case Management oversight with weekly (1)+ hour appointments, mandatory job seeking (3)+ per appointment, Governmental subsidies never be granted ~(10)+ years, supplemental housing never be granted ~(10)+ years;
• Filibuster Reform:
Perfect Proposals, instrumental Acts, life-changing Bills, imperative Amendments that are yielded on the floor, with a system in place of voted-upon of Yeays or Nays, unless getting at least the simple majority in the House (218/435), and concurrently the simple majority in the Senate (51/100), they're dead on arrival, and the only pressure we have is filibustering. Eliminating motions that bring bills to the Senate floor, eliminating filibustering Amendments, and eliminating the no-effort filibuster, would give every Senator a voice but not a veto;
• Homelessness Initiatives:
1...Public Loos, in every City!
2...Public electrical outlets, in every City!
3...Public LaborReady locales to work for (at least) $20.00/day, in every City!
as these basic necessities are not only overlooked, but unprovided as it stands; Whereas, public defication is Illegal; Whereas, loitering is illegal; Whereas, businesses bar our public from even using their services without exchange(s) of monies; Whereas, finding (3) pennies is all that's promised from walking any citystreets for (24)-hours;
• Corporate Credited Reform:
Many Corporations have enabled Refinancing, Loans, credit APRs that at least double mandated-payments with massive interest hikes, risky Mortgages that necessitate paycheck-to-paycheck (20)-year payments, and these practices benefit mostly these Entities, while leaving so many of our fellow Americans in close to impossible arrears;
• Judicial Reform:
When so many massive discrepancies, credible, unjust lawsuits getting completely swept under the rug with dismissals, incredulous taking sides and one-sided judgements, we need an Infrastructure system in place to have oversight over these types of scenarios; a much more involved Supreme Court;
• Financial Regulatory Reform:
Bad banking practices affect our entire Nation on nearly all levels, from the bottom to the top, with a select few able to regulate. And, it is all-encompassing. Measures to assist our fellow citizens with a Risk Assessor, Payment Deliberator, and or an Accountant,  who work for their clientele in reversing foreclosures, stopping bankruptcies, defusing exclusions, and in having a Judge to strictly mitigate Banking cases, will ease these monumental deficits;
and
so very much more!

All our best!

Out of all the 90 minutes of the debate, there's barely any question that was answered, they were just having a chit-chat of arguing that the opponent's the worst presidents. When they're being ask about whether they're capable of being elected as the President of the United States for the next 4 years, what the debaters being arguing is about golf... Is this even revelent to the question? 
Literally, no solution that was given to solve these problems, espically for whether womens have the right to abortion. Joe Biden over there were just talking about a case that happened when there was a women that was rapped by illegal immigrants, whereas Donald Trump over there were blaming Joe Biden for letting the illegal immigrants into the border (and that's basically what Trump being saying throughout the debate). I wonder if Joe Biden has been drinking alcohol before the debate, because he's seriously drunk by mentioning about illegal immigrants rapping an women when he's the person who's responsible for opening up the border at Texas.

His voice was weak, but millions of people have weak voices, and don’t get promotions to higher paying jobs because of that, so the problem is the capitalist wage system that causes world poverty because they expect and need some unemployed workers…who then can’t buy food or medical care for their children. 

Danny Thomas started St. Jude Children’s Hospital to help children who get cancer and their families get treatment because millions couldn’t afford any medical care. His vision evolved from wanting to build a general hospital in the early 1950’s, to becoming a Children’s cancer research hospital, which opened in 1962 and is still funded by generous donors. At that time children had a 20% survival rate, and now has a 94% survival rate for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, using therapy that does not include radiation in 2006."

Look what we have today, just two guys talking about whose golf is better and beating Medicare. In 2012 election, at least they are answering different questions fluently with reverent points, and not hesitating and muttering before every single sentence like Biden did, it’s sad and worrying to see that Michelle Obama is not going to run for president. because under modern Democracy rules, If Joe Biden doesn’t want to quit, we will be left with Trump and Biden 🗿, 



but let’s be real here, Trump is WAY better than Joe in terms of points and topics, though he lied what appears to be over 30 times, he is still the crowd favourite and better that the other one (Biden). Whether you like him or not, he is still one of the most successful and smart businessman and never make America look weak, he is the obvious choice here.

There was a time in the US where moderate Republicans and Democrats shared common interests together, despite their political and ideological differences.

It's bad for the peace of both sides, since they are being taken over by the extreme fringes on either side now, as I said. And this will only create more division domestically.

By the way, here in Europe and especially in Germany we have experiences over many decades with left-wing and right-wing radicals always at each other's throats, since neither of them will ever compromise to the other extreme. Hence they are not solving any problems, only creating more chaos. That's why we have additional political parties in the center in Europe who can tame both sides and introduce common ground and consensus in a professional manner accepted by everyone. They say Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy were such Presidents, to name some American equivalents in history. Bringing lefties and righties together has never been easy though.

I am not a doctor, but I know what that looks like.  

Does it mean he is suffering from Parkinson’s?  Not necessarily.

There are a lot of things that can look like Parkinson’s.

Does it mean he needs to be looked at and monitored?  Yes.

He could just be sick with something. I don’t know because I haven’t watched him over the years.

People would have to watch him over the next debates and his daily interactions.  You don’t know what he’s dealing with. There might be other forces at play that we just don’t know about.

I will say this:  I know Exactly what that looks like to me- but again, I am no doctor and I don’t watch the news or TV very much at all.

The only way to truly know is for him to take levodopa carbidopa and watch what happens.









- I will say this- if he decides to run again, his aides, his top advisors, and any professors that are in his confidence will be more pronounced, as they Should be anyway.
- If he is suffering in silence, you would see (effectively) mostly just his Aides and professors, which ultimately you have to decide if that’s a good or bad thing.
- he needs to stay active in order to not get locked up, if it is the case.  He would need therapy (physical, occupational and linguistically) daily, and constant interaction.

For any person suffering from it, what matters is having meaning and seeing the people that matter most to you.

Plus he was obviously medicated & REFUSED TO TAKE A DRUG TEST BEFORE THE DEBATE. In my opinion he did very well (just like his wife said in the tone you'd use for a 3 year old), the best he could. I'm talking about his performance only - not his policies - which are clearly meant to destroy the USA (good follower of the WEF anti-USA & anti-human agenda). I think Trump could have performed better by being more specific about the economy & his accomplishments. In fact, I don't understand what the left thinks Trump lied about?? I didn't hear any lies from Trump, but I did from Biden. Anyone surprised by Biden's demeanor and behavior has clearly been watching the wrong media - it's been abundantly documented for YEARS. Ask yourslef if you need a new news source because you are not getting the truth. Strangest comment: Biden saying women (need abortion) bc of being raped by their in laws and sisters!

"V11"	0.578	0.981	"Listen to The Real Debate, where Robert Francis Kennedy Jr- independent candidate for 2024 elections, responds to the two who CNN hosted, and presents his solutions.

RFK jnr is the nephew of JF Kennedy, who was president in the 50s and 60s. 
Check out The Real Debate to see him in the debate alongside Trump and Biden, using the Internet tech to skip over CNN and the two parties trying to exclude him, smear him, and pretend he doesn't exist. 

He was the best debater by far, actually having intelligent solutions about the real issues we are facing. For example - Americans have had a 22 percent hike in home insurance and are paying $4 for a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread and $6 for a gallon of gas, then he added: It's because of the forever wars and out-of-control spending by these two gentlemen ... this is the reason they need me on stage, because I will confront them with what they did.

Presently 43 States have time limits on Welfare-GA programs. You can Google this.

In years past a number of Republicans had put time limits also on Welfare-GA benefits. 

People on Social Security and Welfare programs are citiizens  too, so allow this  into this debate. President Joe Biden said in present debate as he is running for President now  that a number of Republicans want to end Social Security. So very sad indeed!

Children,Frail Elderly, Disabled, Blind, Veterans and Spouses are on Social Security which was  put into Law by Congress in 1935 to keep Elderly from starving and not be in need.

They have Constitutional Rights as well. They are  Christianly Christians too on Social.Security and Welfare programs. So have a fear of God and Jesus too. 

People need Food, Safe Shelter and Jobs to live.

Use of Propaganda:

Hitler: Utilized propaganda extensively to spread Nazi ideology, control public perception, and demonize opponents. Joseph Goebbels, his Minister of Propaganda, played a key role in this.

Trump: Frequently used social media and rallies to communicate directly with his base, often bypassing traditional media. He also labeled mainstream media as fake news to undermine their credibility.

Populist Rhetoric:

Hitler: Promoted a nationalist agenda, blaming Jews and other minorities for Germany's problems and promising to restore Germany to its former glory.

Trump: Used populist themes, emphasizing America First, and often blamed immigrants, foreign nations, and political elites for America's issues.

Charismatic Leadership:

Hitler: Cultivated a strong, authoritative image, presenting himself as the savior of Germany.

Trump: Presented himself as a strong leader who could fix the country’s problems, often portraying himself as an outsider fighting against a corrupt establishment.

Scapegoating:

Hitler: Blamed Jews, communists, and other groups for Germany's economic and social woes, leading to severe persecution.

Trump: Frequently blamed immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim-majority countries, as well as political opponents for various issues facing the United States.

Rallying Support through Mass Gatherings:

Hitler: Organized large rallies, such as those in Nuremberg, to energize his supporters and project power.

Trump: Held frequent rallies across the country to maintain enthusiasm among his base and project strength.

Disdain for Democratic Norms:

Hitler: Exploited the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic’s democratic system to gain power and ultimately dismantle it.

Trump: Criticized various democratic institutions and norms, including questioning the legitimacy of elections and the integrity of the judicial system"	"UgwMfluFUvLsIbjYsgp4AaABAg"	"5187"

"V1"	0.381	1	"Question # 1 of the debate was about inflation.

The very first words out of Biden's mouth were lies....

1). Well, You got to take a look at what I was left when I became President. What Mr. Trump left me.

Fake! The condition of the economy was not due to Trump, but due to the pandemic and due to Governor's who mandated the closing of businesses in their states. He was not responsible for that condition other than to say it would have been worse had he not done the things he did. What Mr. Trump left me suggests that what was left was of his doing and it absolutely was not.

2). We had an economy that was in free fall

Lie - people were starting to get vaccines in December and things were  already rapidly returning to normal by late January. Things weren't falling, they were rising.

3). The pandemic was so badly handled, many people were dying and all he said was 'it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach into your arm you'll be alright.

Objectively-Lie, Lie, Lie
A. The pandemic wasn't mishandled. They did try their best, supplying the CDC with the resources to do it's work. Doctors, not politicians lead the response. If social distancing and masking were not effective I wouldn't blame the administration or even the medical scientists who were limited in what could be done. There was no great silver bullet they missed. A great and effective grand thing that would make all the difference. It was small things that had small impacts.

B. Many people were dying, that's true. But anything that comes after the statement of all he said would be a deliberate misrepresentation unless it contained ALL of what he said.

C. The statement he attributed to him was nothing even remotely close to what he said... and it wasn't even based on something he said. It was based on a question he asked someone while not addressing the press. Something he found interesting. That statement was a complete lie and deliberately misleading anyone who heard it. Trump never even used the word bleach. He did use the word disinfectant. A person with a virus is infected. To disinfect a person infected with a virus is to inject an antiviral medication. A virus killer. Antivirus is a disinfectant because it comes in contact with a virus and the virus dies. Antibodies attack infections. The therapy monoclonal antibodies used man made proteins that acted like antibodies in that they bound to the virus and destroyed it. As they disinfected an infected person, and it was an IV injection, they actually did inject people with a type of disinfectant.

4. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs

Absolutely FALSE!!! Businesses couldn't hire because no one wanted to work. Businesses had to struggle to get staff to return as he was taking office. TONS of jobs, no people.

5. The unemployment rate rose to 15%

Lie.... he asked us to look at what he left us. Joe took office late January of 2021, did he not? The month of January 2021 had a 6.3% unemployment rate and was coming down nearly half a percent (.4%). Not as bad as Joe states it and improving. The rebound had begun. The difference between 6.3% and 15% is HUGE!!! Double the 6.3 to 12.6% and you are still way off by thousands and thousands.

If you wanna say he wanted to say that's how bad it once was, he should also give Trump credit for getting it from 15% down to 6.3%. But as you listen, the intent was to make Biden look like he was the one that conquered the 15% unemployment obstacle. No, he spent trillions taking us from 6.3 to around 4%. His goal was to make his achievement look better than it was.

* Next was some pointless words with no claims.

6. We created 15,000 new jobs
               😯
I put that face because of his next statement:

We brought out...
(Ahem)
In a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs

False. This can't be accurate... if you have 800,000 NEW manufacturing jobs, how can you have only created 15,000 jobs? Which one is false because we aren't that bad at math that we can't see one or both are fake numbers. You can't call it truth.

PS: Giving government contracts from money the government doesn't have and thus spending tomorrow's money now is robbing future tax collections. That enlarges the money supply.... that's how you caused the inflation. 

He actually gave one of the answers to thr question here... we created jobs with government money. It's the people who took these jobs and spent their paychecks buying stuff that caused inflation.

Good luck in getting him to acknowledge they over stimulated the economy and that did it. He's probably not smart enough to know that."	"UgzZeQfgyBoBGfgjSmN4AaABAg"	"5302"

I prefer a guy who sometimes makes mistakes & is a little physically unstable but has ethics. Biden has not compulsively tweeted like a child having a tantrum or been moronic enough to suggest injecting bleach, he has acted with the dignity his office. Note Trump sidestepped his position on Ukraine Russia should keep all land it [invaded] now occupies. He also pivoted on the issue of taxing the rich. Illegal immigration actually rose when Trump was in power, he restricted legal migration which could benefit America; building a wall is pointless when illegal immigrants can use boats to avoid it. If Biden continues he must become more assertive as Americans equate confidence with security. It scares me that America may vote for Trump who has a long history of crime, corruption, deception & scandal & would like to have the full authority of Putin over America.

I'm not even pro trump, but Joe DID seek retribution, and what's sad is it's not even surprising. I highly doubt the founding fathers included the 4th amendment with the idea it could be circumvented by one mans reasonable suspicion. America was built off of freedom, yet ppl isn't even free to control their own consciousness. This is the country that technically defines addiction as a disease but nonviolent addicts take up much of the prison space costing something to the tune of $80,000 each per year...some sitting 20 year sentences for a drug that is now legal and sold in stores....Im willing to bet a ONE time payment of $80,000 would've prevented SO much suffering, ultimately getting passed down for generations if used towards prevention, with mental health resources.

But I find it hilarious that the so-called experts say: 'Trump won the debate'....
Let' summarize his results:
1. He never answered the exact questions, and when he sometimes did, he lied shamelessly.
2. He was throwing great words like 'best ever' and 'worst ever' without any foundation or source.
3. He was like a whining child from the daycare: 'the veterans/soldiers like me better than him' and so on... 
4. He showed no sign that he has any kind of program for the future administration at all...
Yes, if you see HOW they talked, maybe Trump was better, but in a political debate/discussion it is way more important WHAT they say. From a professional point of view it was more meaningful what Biden said... and he was trying to answer the questions he received not to avoid them."	"Ugx2t3y7yAkLN7tyuPt4AaABAg"	"6234"

The President of the USA, it turns out, is not only the President of the USA, it is one of the, if not the, President(s) of the entire world. However, only Americans get to vote.

From an European perspective, no one wants Trump. I wonder if people in the Middle East or other parts of the world are any different. Granted, Putin will probably prefer Trump.

All I can ask to the American people is to please be responsible when voting, because the world is in a mess, wars in Ukraine, Palestine, Sudan, etc., and your leader is not just your leader. He is one of, if not the, main leader(s) of the world.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the United States has provided substantial aid to Ukraine. As of early 2024, the total amount of aid approved by Congress for Ukraine stands at nearly $175 billion. This includes a mix of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.

Military Aid: The largest portion of this aid, approximately $117.4 billion, has been allocated for defense-related purposes. This includes weapons systems, training, and intelligence support for the Ukrainian military.
Economic Support: Around $34.8 billion has been provided through the Economic Support Fund, aimed at sustaining essential government services in Ukraine, such as law enforcement and other critical infrastructure.
Humanitarian Aid: An estimated $22.6 billion has been dedicated to humanitarian efforts, including support for refugees and other forms of economic assistance.

"V1"	1	1	"Grocery prices in the United States did not go up by 100%, but they did see significant increases during the recent period of high inflation. Here's a detailed look at the situation:

Key Points on Grocery Price Increases:
Inflation Impact:

Inflation impacted many sectors, including groceries, with notable increases in prices. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home increased significantly from 2021 through 2023.
Percentage Increases:

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the CPI for food at home increased by 6.5% in 2021, 11.4% in 2022, and continued to rise in 2023 but did not double in price.
Specific categories saw varying increases. For example, in 2022, the prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rose by 12.5%, and dairy products increased by 11.8%​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​.
Contributing Factors:

Supply Chain Disruptions: Ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect production and distribution.
Labor Costs: Increased labor costs due to shortages and wage increases also contributed to rising prices.
Input Costs: Higher costs for raw materials, transportation, and packaging impacted the final prices of groceries.
Global Events: The Russia-Ukraine conflict further exacerbated food prices, especially affecting commodities like wheat and corn​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​.
Detailed Statistics:
Meats, Poultry, Fish, and Eggs: Up 12.5% in 2022
Dairy Products: Up 11.8% in 2022
Fruits and Vegetables: Up 8.4% in 2022
Non-Alcoholic Beverages: Up 8.0% in 2022​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​​ (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)​.
Sources:
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

Guys, I’m from Russia, we don’t want to capture anyone, this is propaganda! That we all drink vodka and have our own personal bear. You are being fooled, middle class!  Also, we live very well, the sanctions have not affected us at all. We live the same way we lived! Only your president transfers money to Ukraine, and your broken equipment appears with us! Guys, we are very friendly, come, I can show you Moscow. And it’s a pity for you that your president, like a “guppy fish” Biden, is clearly not himself.  I'm sorry that your president is keeping the whole world in suspense. I recommend watching the interview with Tucker) I also had a good laugh at your old man, Biden is just a character from a stupid American comedy like Scary Movie.  I feel sorry for you, but if Biden remains in power, I will order myself a beer and watch Biden’s address as a humorous character, his eyes, mouth, facial expressions, speech, it’s just as if it’s surreal!!!

"V1"	0.73	1	"Leaving NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) could have several significant negative consequences for a member country. Here are some key reasons why it might not be a good idea:

Security and Defense:

Collective Defense: NATO's principle of collective defense (Article 5) means that an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. This provides a significant deterrent against potential aggressors.
Military Support: NATO members benefit from the military capabilities and strategic assets of other member nations. Leaving NATO would mean losing access to this extensive support network.
Geopolitical Influence:

Global Influence: NATO membership enhances a country's influence on the global stage. Member states participate in high-level discussions and decision-making processes on international security and defense.
Regional Stability: NATO plays a crucial role in maintaining stability in Europe and its neighboring regions. Leaving NATO could diminish a country's influence in these areas and weaken regional security.
Economic Implications:

Defense Spending: NATO members share the burden of defense spending, which can help reduce individual costs. Outside of NATO, a country might have to increase its defense budget significantly to compensate for the loss of collective security.
Economic Security: Stability provided by NATO contributes to economic security and investor confidence. Leaving NATO could create uncertainty and negatively impact the economy.
Political Relationships:

Alliances and Partnerships: NATO fosters strong political and military alliances among member countries. Leaving could strain these relationships and isolate the country from important allies.
Diplomatic Support: Being part of NATO ensures diplomatic backing from other member countries in times of crisis. This support would be harder to come by outside the alliance.
Technological and Intelligence Sharing:

Advanced Technology: NATO members benefit from shared access to advanced military technology and innovations. Leaving NATO could limit access to such resources.
Intelligence Cooperation: NATO facilitates extensive intelligence sharing among its members. This cooperation enhances national security by providing critical information on potential threats.
Historical and Moral Commitment:

Commitment to Democratic Values: NATO promotes democratic values and the rule of law. Leaving NATO could be perceived as a step away from these principles.
Historical Alliances: Many countries have long-standing historical ties and commitments to NATO. Leaving the alliance could undermine these historical relationships and commitments.
Overall, leaving NATO could undermine national security, weaken geopolitical influence, strain economic stability, and diminish important political and military alliances. The benefits of membership, including collective defense, shared resources, and enhanced global standing, far outweigh the potential drawbacks of withdrawal."	"Ugz-NXw0mr-NVxRVqDZ4AaABAg"	"6812"

These hosts asked them.He can still answer some of these.Then Trump was involved in immigration and who is good and who is bad.Then they were like clowns again.What makes me speechless most is who else they talk about playing golf well.If the host hadn't reminded them in time, I believe they could have quarreled about golf all day.😅"	"Ugwhr3MHApiIqQg_QRJ4AaABAg"	"6889"

She whispered to Trump, You see how smart I am, the shopkeeper didn't see anything, and I don't even need to lie. I will definitely defeat you and win the presidency of the United States! Trump said, Is it your usual style to act deceitfully and steal in order to achieve your goals? In fact, you can also achieve the same result in an honest way. Look at me! So Trump said to the bakery owner, I am the Republican presidential candidate Trump, and I will perform a magic trick for you to show me. Please help me pass this pastry to me. The shop owner was very curious and immediately gave him a piece of pastry as he instructed. Trump wolfed it down and asked for another piece, but also swallowed it. Then Trump ordered a third piece of cake and took another bite into his stomach. At this moment, the shop owner was a bit puzzled and asked Trump when the magic would appear.

🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
🙏🏼👉🏼John 3:3 NIV

3 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.”



🙏🏼👉🏼2 Chronicles 7:13-14 NIV

13 “When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people, 14 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.

🙏🏼👉🏼Romans 10:8-13 NIV

8 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. 11 As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”"	"UgxKjbn7FzhiI0WlSNZ4AaABAg"	"7237"

Wanted to watch this debate because I just wanted to see how joe Biden would do, and I knew he was not gonna compete well enough. I do not like Biden for he destroyed this country. Trump did great as MY president he is not a close person in my personal life, so why should I care if he did F*cked a pornstar all those years ago, and if he lied about it so what. I do not know the full story of Jan 6., but we can not just sit here and listen to he said or what she said. Apparently Jan 6 was really bad people got hurt/killed and trump did nothing about that, but I have not looked into it to see proof or what, but again how can I trust that info when i cant even trust what i see on YT or whatever. I don't know what is a lie and whats not, but what I do know is that everyone is now in complete shock when the see Biden on stage by himself completely fail at his job. how in the world did the dems not see this coming. trump did his part and in 2016-2020 there were no wars there was no inflation, my dad was not struggling this much, I heard nothing about the border or Afghanistan. I just wish people really take a look at this debate and see why trump would be a better president. I would rather have a person who looks strong and can talk, AND also has a past of doing great things. I just wanted to rant because I am truly scared if  biden or any dem under that biden party wins."	"UgzQklUxAf1kRF54FQ54AaABAg"	"7328"

There's no reason for a lock and security company to slow down if you think about it.  And then there's the current governor of California and the jerks in Sacramento who want to gut me as a small business owner. My company was way busier when Trump was in and everybody was running and gunning..We were running like headless chickens. The commercial and industrial market was hammering! My customers had money and plans. There's still good construction going on in San Diego, but the interest rates, inflation, and regulations, and whatever else, have an arm around the neck of a company like mine.

What has changed is my perception of the Democrats led by their much too old POTUS, Joe Biden. I held this party to a higher standard predominantly due to their more noble rhetoric. However, given the reports of the Democratic leadership after the June 27 Presidential debate, my conclusion sadly is that both parties are similar in substance but differ in style. Both leaders only care about power at the expense of all else including the welfare of the country. Since both crave unadulterated power, the sycophantic handlers around them can’t help cuz they also don't want to hit the unemployment line anytime soon. This is the corrosive effect of an endless supply of money into the system creating more disparity between the classes. Didn’t history teach us this is the foundation for revolution? Is Trump just the logical next step in America’s evolution?

Pundits say this corruption, fueled by donor  money, accelerated since the Reagan era. Not much time left to correct the course of American Democracy once held as the ideal for the rest of the world to aspire. Perhaps we've all been deluded by the perceived nobility of men.

I also held out faith for the FLOTUS to do the right thing but she is proving to be yet another sycophant. Everything is about status and power mirroring their spouse. In that sense the despicable MAGA's are more honest.

If the Democrats think they can defeat Trump with the current Biden then they are delusional. If the world thinks that America is the beacon of Democracy paid by the blood of their WW2 veterans then the rest of us are delusional.

He did not lie about anything of substance to the debate questions thrown his way. If you can prove he lied, then don't just say he lied, explain how when and why you believe he lied.

I watched the whole debate, where did trump lie, he corrected biden several times they weren't lies, he said he left and handed biden a great start which he did, even though covid had hit hard by then, things were still fairly stable, he did reduce ilegal immigration to a all time low, had unemployment at a 50yr low, fuel and other costs were low, taxes were less thus more in the workers pockets, no wars started on his watch, were the lies. Biden did remove or delete 90 odd exec orders, the only way trump could get anything done cause dems rejected everything or said would agree if he agreed to fund numerous waste of tax papers mobey projects, biden did start of with vaccines already out and working, jobs bouncing back, borders opening, shops reopening, 1.7% inflation, a secure border happy voters still, still no wars and a secure border.

Bidens 1st 100 days, inflation starts, food fuel and other costs increase, interest rates became higher, wages value plummeting, ilegal immigration increases, crime increases, taxed laws, no bail jail cards. Where are the lies. Seems to me, the d3mocratic baklvkers and voters have been lied to, they have been kept in the dark about just how bad biden had got in 3 years."

Why is the government's solution to their failures; always take more money from the people, take more possessions from people, limit your information, become storytellers or start wars..? It just doesn't make any sense to build somebody or a group of people up to just make a mockery and then take it back from them for your own gain. He did the same thing with Obama back in 2008, we went into a recession then.. ONLY reason why we didn't go into one here recently is because of covid.

On CNN, Van Johnson said to be clear I love Joe Biden., but This was painful. Be fair, likely the results of this debate will be that Trump likely will gain 5% nationally in the polls pushing Biden's vote down into the low 30s.  Biden has been loosing for some time now and been failing publically, but there will be no recovery for his candidacy now.  The donations to Trump will double, and the donations now for Biden will fall like a rock.  Biden has won the Democrat nomination, but he is not capable to run for re-election.  For the sake of the country, and his party, Joe Biden shouild release his delegates and have his Party select an alternate nominee to represent the Party.

There will be no lying your way out of his righteousness judgement, you will not have a spokes person to make excuses for your actions. You won’t have any agency, or politicians to cover for your crimes! If I was you Joe, I would throw myself on the ground on my face and repent! And plead with the Lord for mercy! I would confess my sins,and forsake them, while you still have breath in your lungs! God delights in mercy Joe! And if you truly repent, confess your sins, and forsake your sin, and turn to righteousness, he will not remember the wickedness you continue to commit, and will forgive you, and save your soul alive!

Thinking a little outside the box ... think Kamala Harris for pres and Adam Kinzinger (R) for VP.

There are millions of Never Trumper Repubs who would stay home before voting for trump, (trump's hardcore base is about 35%) and Kinzinger gives the OTHER 15% of Repubs the option of voting Dem WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE! 

THIS OPTION WOULD BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER!!! and I feel MOST REAL AMERICANS very tired of ALL the divisiveness!!!

Kamala would keep the women/black/and moderate Dem wings, plus she is already a well known face who is already well qualified. Latest polling I've seen is that Kamala is only 1-2 pts (after the debate) behind trump in a one on one. I even think many Dems/Indes could like Kinzinger ... he is not a crazy trumpster!!

trump is the most dangerous person to EVER run, he is simply Hitler reincarnated. He simply promised the rich more riches for their vote!!

And just as Hitler destroyed Germany in 10 years through gross miscalculation and winnable wars, trump could see the US destroyed in just 15 minutes by being stupid and a single miscalculation sparking a nuclear war. 

In an estimated nuclear war.... 500 MILLION to 4 billion!! I think (and I am VERY Hopeful) the military has already put into effect internal controls that would prevent a-like trump madman from setting of a world-ending conflict!  (Remember very small scale trump's easy to win trade war??!!??)
 
Plus the Repubs could NOT say that It (whatever IT is ...... immigration, inflation, Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, etc) , is all the Dems fault. It breaks a very important link to the Dems if Biden is gone. Inflation is a result of what the FEDS do ... NOT the Administration does. But the Administration does get blamed.

Let's reunite the USA again! Let Biden's legacy would be that he stepped aside to strengthen America, not because he was weak ... but smart ... Country over self!!!

"V6"	0.612	0.977	"Here is what everyone needs to understand about dementia. It is progressive and President Biden definitely has it. The fact that he is functional from 10-4 shows that he is sundowning, which is what he was doing on the debate stage at 9pm. He shuffles when he walks. He often has a frozen stance and a blank stare with a gaped mouth. He is often unsure which way to go to get off a stage. These are clear signs of dementia. His handlers won't let him do press conferences or answer free form questions. It is absolutely dangerous that our enemies have seen this display. My dad had dementia and could be very lucid and logical when he was rested and hydrated. He would become disoriented when he was tired, and what I saw on the debate stage from President Biden was exactly what I would see with my dad when he was tired. The fact that he is using travel and a cold as an excuse is ridiculous. The president should be able to function 24/7 with frequent travel and an occasional cold. This is no excuse for that display. And remember dementia is progressive once it starts. So you can't say he has been great the last 4 years so he should be trusted with the presidency. This makes no sense with dementia. He is just going to get worse. And it is not diagnosable with a brain scan. Alzheimers can only be definitively diagnosed through an autopsy. A cognitive test may or may not determine dementia depending on the moment when it is taken. I saw my dad pass a cognitive test even when he was delusional about other things later that same day or during that same week. During this same time, he would drive down the street and then forget which way to come home. President Biden has dementia. I am completely convinced of this and every American who saw the debate and has seen dementia in a family member is as well. How do I vote for someone with this condition? We couldn't let my dad be in charge of the simple aspects of his life. I had to help him with his pills and doctor appointments. The leader of the Free World cannot have dementia! This is irresponsible and I feel that the President Biden's handlers have completely betrayed this country and our allies."	"UgwdaMa9s4gUA7offBh4AaABAg"	"10841"

4 more years of fentanyl, 4 more years of illegal immigrants, 4 more years of double-digit inflation, 4 more years of letting criminals go FREE, 4 more years of store closings because thieves on not prosecuted, 4 more years of leaving Marines in Afghanistan for the Taliban 4 more years of broken promises to blacks and Hispanics. 4 more years of hearing Joe's uncle eaten by cannibals!

Trump, and now for Biden to have any chance to WIN the 2024 U S. Presidential election, So how to make the present situation a positive win for Joe R. Biden Jr., The Nation, and its People ? Joe R. Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden's Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November, to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? Most voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr  would be mentoring as the Senior Statesman He is, to eventually hand over the Presidential Office to His history-making centrest, and Independent politically thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III at any time after a 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, “all-ready” to be a calming force who is often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus  building, Independent person. Presidenting, and demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership like that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken, likable human being, with high integrity, showing excellent communications skills as United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect centered choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation’s Leaders to govern, and, most important to reset, then heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity and, away from the National collective abyss coming seemingly closer each day. I can envision a President Joe Manchin the third, as a true uniter the Country needs most, having a White House Cabinet, and Administration full of moderate thinking, U.S. Citizens always and, above all, wishing to focus on a better life for We the People. An administration built from a mix Democratic, Independant, and Republican bent folks successfully managing together the people's business in a common sense first, thoughtful, daily approach fashion who foremost always emulate a President Joe Manchin III’s mannerisms. How pleasing to all it would be to have a United States Executive branch who puts People’s needs before Political Parties needs. I’m for a history making period like that, so many others would be too, as the way to reunite the United States of America while showing decorum. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this momentous task ahead, or even the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! President Joe Biden, honestly it is your time to “Man Up”,”protect the Country that you have sworn to protect”, and put “We the People” first, and above personal needs of Yourself, the desires of Family members or your best political party associate's types who , you know, most unfortunately put “Party First Before Country” who walk a very miss guided, warped, power first desiresies above all else agenda path. Joe R. Biden Jr. please cast these influencers aside, make the right choice, at the right time, for our Country, of who would be the better Vice President, who will make right what is not right within these United States as the next U.S. President, to the benefit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should be our best forward facing identity, together when less divided we can decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential centrest performance, and our then combined united agreement in such. So as you often say, Joe R. Biden Jr. , “Cut The Malarkey” of having  Kamala Harris as your 2024 Democratic V.P. running mate ! Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by veering away from the Political Polarization of today dividing “We the People” with selecting a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III to have close by your side now until November 2024, and on to Win the Whitehouse for a second term this November. Why because a centrist thinking moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward to right what's wrong with the United States read another way “us”.

The media complains that he goes way, way off topic and needs to stick to them. It is perfectly fine that Trump has them and should be using them more. On the other side is Biden. He has access too, he uses them as well. Now media and maybe some democrates are saying that the teleprompters are not good, for Biden anyway, and he needs to use his own voice and thoughts and not rely on those same teleprompters. I've been raised, and believe, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If it's ok for Trump to have them, then it's okay for Biden. Look, I understand the importance of that first debate. Regardless, 1 bad debate doesn't negate all he has done. The facts haven't changed. Biden is only in this race because Trump announced his candidacy super early. I'm sure there was discussion on whether or not to join the race. If he gets pulled out now, all bets are off, Trump wins and our children and grandchildren grow up in Russia but on American soil. Instead of fleeing the ship, maybe our democratic leaders should swim back to the ship and help to bail water and keep it from fully submerging. Yes, both men are old, after this I really hope Congress will pass mandatory retirement age for presidents, or add a no older than age to the restrictions. None of this matters if Trump wins or tries to steal the election. With Biden we have a chance of success, then we can all breath easy for democracy has been saved . Of course with the new supreme court rulings, he could just have Trump and his followers assasinated due to the extreme threat every single one of them are to this country.

His policies aren’t what people are worried about; it’s about his capability to effectively run for and serve another term. There’s been a narrative that he’s getting too old and declining for a while now, that I didn’t pay much attention to until the debate. All this debate did was confirm that narrative in the eyes of the viewers. I’m not sure how or if he can turn this around. I will vote for Biden if he’s our nominee, but I’m not sure if there are enough people still willing to vote for him to win now. I don’t know how big of an effect the debate will have on people.

According to investigations, Trump’s rental applications were secretly marked with the applicant’s race, and doormen were coached to discourage Black people from renting.

It’s not anything they can control.” On the other hand, Trump stated that Jews were good at counting money.

It was a slip of words, not being cognitively out of it. People show their lack of understanding with how they react to this. And during the stress of public speaking, a debate, it can be a lot more than cognitive state going on, with mistakes possible.

Cars are expensive because of the EV push causing manufacturers to switch powertrains and plans last minute, causing them to lose money and that is passed onto the consumer. Chip shortage also didn’t help and that wasn’t the presidents fault. 

I don’t think the economy would have been MUCH different under Trump. I think, it would have been better, just slightly. 

No extra 2021 stimulus check. No free money through interest rates being easy. No crying about a vaccine mandate, while inflation was sky high in 2021-2022. Oil production took a hit in those years of the EV push.

1. Short term economy 

2. Long term economy

——both of these just like at macro statistics and not the average and median growth has been. Just overall GDP growth. So if the GDP grew but only the top 5% of Americans get it (which is what’s happening recently) then the stats don’t matter- so these two are actually FALSE. Why? Well because money has been going to the top 5% not the the rest of the 95% of voters. So to THEM the economy long and short term is actually bad. 

3. Scandal key

——subjective. Biden has extreme distaste from veterans. Many many voters believe he is not mentally fit. That id scandalous. But trump doesn’t get this either. 

4. Charisma

——just no. Trump has much more charisma than biden and being unbiased here. Narrow audience? His events are PACKED with people. Biden’s are not: this is completely subjective and the professor is showing favoritism here.

5. Third party 

—-RFK is losing polling numbers so he’s not at all going to steal votes soon.

6. Social unrest—- my bad I guess all the Israel and Palestine protests just don’t count in all the major cities.

7. Foreign military success/failure. Trump gets this key. Biden failed in Afghanistan, has failed to end the ukraine war, and has failed to end the Middle East war. Compared to trump which has a legacy of not having. Any major war.

On Charisma, Lichtman claims, without putting too fine a point on it, that Trump has a narrow appeal to people with a certain mind set. Trump has pulled more non-republican voters than any republican candidate ever, and polls are moving his way. 

Scandal. C'mon, Lichtman. How can you present Hunter Biden's scandals in a vacuum and think you're being honest? Hunter, other family members, and friends wouldn't have made a dime off of China or Ukraine if his daddy wasn't VP, and now president. Talk about a president who's beholden to foreign interests!

"V1"	0.518	1	"How about this:

1) Inflation is higher 

2) Cost of common goods and commodities have risen $2.50 - $4.00 since 2019

3) Ukraine conflict has risen its death toll to approximately 535,000 deaths since Putin invaded.  This death toll only reflects that of Ukrainian and/or NATO/Coalition forces.  Russia invaded Ukraine after the humiliating departure of the US out of Afghanistan.

4) there are roughly 9 US hostages being held in Afghanistan today in 2024. Although it has been reported, they’ve been given respect, good quarter, and being fed all connections to what is called for, and the Geneva convention, but yet still has not been released.

5) Afghanistan withdrawal was reactive at best, hasty, and sloppy, leaving over $1 billion in equipment, military, advancements, and land in air warfare navigation systems.

6) BLM scams hundreds of donors and is found to be a disorganized grifting scheme.  Was then later dismantled then shortly after decentralized to different groups throughout the US unrelated to one another. With the founders somewhat disappearing from the spotlight with one of the founders moving to Canada. 

7) military getting involved in identity politics, have extremely weakened our forces. Reports have been given throughout the ranks, and lack of arsenal and weaponry. 

8) over $1 billion and aid given to the Ukraine in a unwinnable war with over 545,000 lives lost on the Ukraine and coalition side. Biden has reported he does not send money but weapons to the Ukraine, which are over $1 billion. All these weapons are being misused, destroyed, and otherwise lost in the battlefield of an unwinnable war.

9) local terrorist group who unfortunately run the Gaza strip, and that a Palestine power one of the 18 tribes within Palestine, Hamas, had a few of its militants raid towns and events, killing both women and children in a sudden surprise attack.

10) more money being printed, and being sent to Israel to fund more bombing campaigns and other resources in the Middle East and Israel.  

11) recap so far, we have two foreign wars that break out, and an embarrassing withdrawal from a 15+ year war, high inflation rates, hostages left behind.

12) Biden administration talks about gun control and they need to stop guns but yet release one of the worlds largest arms dealer in exchange for a WNBA player who has spoken out against her own country and was found with an illegal substance in Russia.

13) transvestite privileges, and other weird sexual niche groups calling for reform in our own government in order for them to have power over our children. Teaching kids before they even learn about sex, about homosexuality and multiple genders that are nothing more than a fantasy.

14) world leaders are turning their backs on our country, saying that they feel for America and hope they get better? Really?

15) Joe Biden calls the president of China a dictator right in his face in California SMH

16) California far left governor Gavin Newsom, made California, essentially an area of low income and Haven for vagrants. With beautiful street corners and alleys, now littered with homeless, tents and vagrancy throughout. So much that local businesses in the area have installed water hoses on the top of their roof to ensure that no tents are propped up against their buildings.

17) a president who can hardly remember what day it is literally, being sent out to negotiate with world leaders that are on top of their game. God knows what has been said in those meetings. We see the frustration of some leaders like the leader of Brazil basically yelling at Joe Biden for not paying attention at a rally he attended back in 2022. 

18) evidence arise of the president and his son conducting business deals on the backend with foreign nationals and businesses utilizing the backing of this political background, to get signatures to get money flowing into Biden‘s pockets, not Americas.

19) lie lie about Donald Trump have been proven. It’s not only his own supporters, but also Democrats alike.

19) the current United States cabinet literally having no functionality whatsoever, but just meeting. They just meet to plan other meetings. Literally there is nothing being done. We are just plopped up. That’s it.

20) utilizing a false narrative that racial injustices, abortion, and project 2025 is the issue with the United States as well as climate change, meanwhile the same people protesting against that are becoming poor as the day goes by and wonder why it cost over $10 for a carton of eggs

21) 250,000 jobs lost from the oil, rigs and roughnecks who worked those rigs without a job as soon as Biden went into Office. This is inevitably caused oil prices to increase nearly $2.50 more and rising.

22) huge auto decline nationwide increasing prices for vehicles. 

23) illusion that more jobs are being created and the economy is in “good condition” just because your “black rocks” and other similar organizations have so much dead money to work with they are buying up all real estate and neighborhoods through the United States.

24) our economy is so great according to Biden that interest rates went from being 3.75% back in 2019 now over 9% lol 😂 causing the housing market to gradually decrease in activity

25) Mass influx of illegal immigration once known as “asylum“ are now a disorganized mess being labeled “immigration“ with no type of processes, checks of balances, with women, being raped and women and children killed with over four incidents in the US so far. New York neighborhoods and luxury hotel buildings have been vacated for the mass influx of immigration and people who have nothing to bring to this country other than exploits and their own grief and drama.

26) inflation is bad, but immigration is even worse, with it spreading all over the other US states now every state is almost like a border state with no checks and balances as stated above. The VP, who is still in charge of the border, has evidently and apparently ignored that entire task and does nothing but assigned blame and point the finger when asked questions about it and changes the subject with anger.

27) we have an unfit president who is well over his timeline and cannot think properly and a jealous vice president who secretly hates the person she is under. Rumors of constant feuding within the cabinet has been reported throughout the Biden administration presidency, which is unprofessional.

28) further pandering to minorities such as the black American, who have fought so hard for their place in this country, being held back again with a holiday Juneteenth, and which many black Americans reject, but now is a national holiday. If you want racism to stop, stop talking about it. Two people have said that before that was Morgan Freeman, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..

29) scandals and unchecked groups who have influences within our state government, showing people being protected such as that of Puff Daddy, who was found to beat his wife and girlfriend at the time, but was a huge proponent for Joe Biden, and his coalition.

30) hundred percent dismantling of our military, literally our military is just a showpiece. It has been weakened greatly in the last four years.  

31) most of America oil reserves, which was well over a few billion dollars of those reserves for either high emergencies and or wartime, have been 95% depleted by the Biden administration to basically ease. America’s worries about the gas prices increasing. The biggest depletion of these reserves was in the summer of 2022 and 2023 when gas prices started to increase rapidly, the Biden administration injected these reserves to ease the panic of the American people. Rather than being honest and telling the truth, put on a façade as if the gas prices were declining just for those same prices to shoot up even higher the following months.

32) we have had our countries identity and culture stepped on and totally erased or attempted to be erased from history with petitions on knocking down statues, etc.

Another four years of the above points this will not be a country anymore, but rather it will decline into what we would know as a “banana Republic“ and shortly thereafter would be a fallen state which will leave it open to foreign enemy takeover   we have too many people in this country who do not even like the United States, but are embedded it now and it’s fabric. Instead of just going elsewhere since they don’t like it, there are like a germ or a disease that is constantly spreading deter the American platform change needs to happen"	"Ugw_UVVOHgmnrZwJMfl4AaABAg"	"13168"

The Democrats would be very lucky to convince him to withdraw his candidacy for reelection, and the odds of getting him to Retire or Resign before his term is over is basically Zero.

The only way to force the issue is for the Vice President and most of the Presidents Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office for Medical Reasons, in which case VP Kamala Harris becomes the Acting President.

Besides, almost without exception, whenever a political party has NOT nominated a sitting President for a second term and someone else gets the nomination, they invariably lose in the General Election.   That is a historical fact.

As has been pointed out, the Democrats believe that if they don’t replace President Biden with another nominee that they will lose to Former President Trump in November.  That’s speculation at this point, but I can understand why they would feel that way.

The problem for Democrats is, is that if they replace President Biden as their nominee then that all but guarantees that the Democrats will lose to Former President Trump in November.

It sounds to me that the Democrats have what’s sometimes called a no win scenario… Former President Trump will most likely win the Presidency in November, 2024.

Like Hillary...Trump will hyper motivate the opposition to vote.  However comma also like Hillary (with Dems), there are a enough Republicans who would either vote for Biden or not vote at all before they vote for Trump (TY Lincoln Project & never Trumpers etc).  Fortunately, Biden doesn't carry that Clinton baggage, yet Dems still detest Trump and when he is on the ballot or his ideology is front and center - we show up for the party - evidenced by the unlikely Dem wins/special elections in 2018, 20 & 22 - trust the history.  Dems will ALL come home when Trump is the alternative (and now Biden has a record to run on) whereas Trump has only gotten worse - trust the history.  Unless some of these weak-knee'd Dems have an ulterior motive or agenda...this is easy math.  Dems will come home when the choice is a guy that wants to be a dictator, the supreme court has cleared the way for a dictatorship and Project 2025 is due to destroy democracy as we know it.  Remember I said this.  You're Welcome! 

Bonus nugget.  Trump's max is 47%, he has lost too many people to get any higher.  Biden will win with 50% because there are more of us than them.  We don't need Republicans to win...we just need Dems to continue to show up and we're going to be just fine.  Mr. President, please continue to be yourself and dance with the ones that brought you here or you're going to wind up like Al Gore and John Kerry - being over coached trying to be all things to all people.

The high success of Newton's astronomy was in one way an intellectual
disaster: it produced an illusion from which we tend still to suffer. This
illusion was created by the circumstance that Newton's mechanics had a good
model in the solar system. For this gave the impression that we had here an ideal
of scientific explanation; whereas the truth was, it was mere obligingness on
the part of the solar system, by having had so peaceful a history in recorded
time, to provide such a model. For suppose that some planet had at some
ume erupted with such violence that its shell was propelled rocket-like out of
the solar system. Such an event would not have violated Newton's laws; on
the contrary, it would have illustrated them. But also it would not have heen
calculable as the past and future motions of the planets are presently
calculated on the assumption that they can be treated as the simple 'bodies'

No one got exactly what they wanted with those bills but if Democrats wouldn't have arose to the occasion how many would have starved by now because a minority had a fantasy about being the majority? How many trillions in increased debt load would we have because of an increase in interest rates because our credit rating slipped, would the dollar still be the world currency, and all kinds of other huge questions? I remember Trump and the freedom caucus wanted to just let the bills go unpaid. And there's nothing they can do to make me forget their temper tantrum tactics. The absolute smartest thing GOP could have done is dump Trump but i guess they're not smart enough to figure it out without the pens at the voting booth. I'm sure after watching them as long as i have they'll be shell shocked wondering how it happened. What was it someone said, If you allow criminals to get away with something you have to expect them to increase their game. If we allow them to get away with being unproductive... even if they didn't get exactly what they wanted, we should expect them to become more and more unproductive and violent when they don't get what they expected.

He may also be miscalling a number of his keys:  technically, we may not be in a recession, but most people don't feel great about the economy; Trump may not be generationally charismatic, but there's a HUGE gap between his charisma and Biden's.  Strictly speaking, there can be only one incumbent, but since both have track record as president, we effectively have two.  Lastly, actively concealing that Biden has such severe dementia that he may not be able to govern seems like about as big a scandal as one could imagine.

It is not possible to give Harris the benefits of incumbency when she is polling even worse than Biden, the real incumbent.

Gavin Newsom's state is a trainwreck. You can rob a store as long as you steal under $900.00. What kind of ethics and morality is that?  Should thieves bring their calculators when they rob?  So, stores have just shut their doors. Closing down commerce is not a path to success.  Tent cities abound, and homeless people are using the streets as a toilet. Open toilets smell and breed disease. And, illegal fentanyl is not the answer to getting rid of your homeless population. That's also unethical, illegal and immoral. Replacing the middle class who are leaving in droves with illegal immigrants is also not the path to success. 

Shall I can continue?

The seismologist had done a lot of research trying to predict earthquakes, looking at all sorts of phenomena that people though occurred just before an earthquake.  I don't know how successful he was in finding a set of keys that would by majority vote predict an earthquake (note that Lichtman's keys predict an incumbent party loss if 6 of 13–a majority—are unfavorable for the incumbents).  Instead of looking at earthquakes, Lichtman looked at what had happened in presidential elections from 1860 to 1976.  I don't know what else he considered but his keys are the 13 that always preceded an incumbent part loss if 6 were negative for the incumbent party.  Which 6 differed from election to election.  If there was one which always preceded an incumbent party loss, then that's all that would be needed (I don't think there's anything magic in the number 13).  I'm not sure which recent election the keys failed on; I think they predicted a Gore win in 2000, and he did win the popular vote.  OTOH, they predicted Benjamin Harrison's win despite his loss of the popular vote (due to violent suppression of Republican votes in one region of the country where the Democrats got no more electoral votes for 70% or 80% of the vote than they wo8uld have for only 55% or 60%)."

This is also based on his (democrat) opinion- most republicans WOULD say Biden has been in a scandal, covering up his cognitive state, his connection to his son and the implications he was involved as well, prosecuting Trump, etc. You can not AGREE with that which is fine but you can’t ignore the fact many people do believe those things. 

Also- saying Trumps charisma only pertains to a “narrow” group of people is absurd. He got almost as many votes as Biden in the last election- he did not lose by a “landslide.” I would not consider that to be a “narrow” group of people who like him and are fanatics lol. Barack Obama was not “universally” liked either as he won 52% of the popular vote meaning 48% voted against him. Trump won 47% of the popular vote.

A) Run with Biden & Harris = Lose by a wide margin perhaps a landslide
B) Riun with Biden & someone else = ???, but probably a loss.  It is clear to me and a lot of others that Biden won't last another 4 
          years with the strain of being the President of the US.  Hence the VP taking over.   Most people would see this as an 
          Admission that Biden is a false candidate.  Hence the probably a LOSS.
C) Harris & Someone else = a higher probability of a Loss.  Since she was the first to be Forced To Drop Out in the 2020 Primaries,
          and has a high unpopularity score.....
D) Someone else as Presidential & Anyone else as VP = A Notable Loss!  Since this would be seen as proof that behind the scenes
         power (aka the machine) prevent a fair 2024 Primary in the Democratic Party.  i.e. The Fix was in & the Emperor is not
         wearing any clothes scenario (after the First Debate).  And if they hold the Second Debate, that has fewer rules to protect
         Biden.  It will be a wipeout of. Biden!  If they don't hold the 2nd Debate it will be equally bad as it will be seen as an admission &
         proof that Biden has Dementia and/or Alzheimers!

Whether it is Biden doing it covertly or those that are propping Biden calling those shots, pulling the plug on the DNC is the easiest way to be done with the manipulators both directly & indirectly. Then there's the connection of dots. While Joe Biden faces no scandal beyond Hunter Biden's legal scandals. Biden was VPOTUS at the beginning of it all. There is no divorcing the IRS tax evasion from Burisma, Ukraine, the laptop, the Big Guy. Anyone the D's trot out to replace Biden with, really has a monumental task ahead of them, considering the state of the nation. All those economic indicators, recession, employment are a matter of the inflation to where the masses (voters) are paying dearly for the Biden-Harris spin, smoke & mirrors of prosperity. J6 ? The coup of Trump was the sequential progression & combined misfortunes of 2019-2020. Nobody could've been as unfortunate as Trump was as a sitting POTUS. And 2021-present, nobody could be as unfortunate as he masses of American voters. Regardless of Biden or the entirety of the DNC pulling this off, D's & R's have to know it's been going on for effectively & essentially 8 years  to 2016.

But Biden is full of scandles, like letting him off for having stolen classified documents back when he was a Senator and as VP. The same thing they went after Trump for, except Biden did not have the authority to remove them from DC or declassify them. He also had them kept in several very unsecured places where anyone could get a hold of them without anyone knowing they were nissing. Many of these documents were Top Secret like plans to defend Taiwan if China invaded. He treated those documents like they were old newspapers. 
As for Trump, he had the authority to declassify and they were all stored on an Island secured by the Secrete Service. There was a huge difference. The same for the case against hm, it is falling apart and the prosecutor has lied on several occasions about what was in those boxes and they were not secured as many people had gone through those boxes and there is no telling what might have been removed or if things were added. Another thing, if anyone has been through a big move and hired a moving company, you would know that they move fast and pack everything. I've been through several moves in my military service and can tell you that they packed a kitchen trash can full of trash, a baby items carrier with full bottles and more. Trump or the people that were responsible for the transition and moving Trumps stuff out of the White House and Preidence office hired a company to do it. Even with a person watching them they could have packed items that they shouldn't have. And from all reports Trump was working with the Archive people to return items they wanted. But Biden had the DOJ raid his place. Even then the FBI screwed it up by placing those classified markers in the floor, taking pictures and leaking them to the press."

You know what you can't overlook? What you don't have to make an effort to learn about, but which hits you in the face every week? The price of groceries. If you were seeing $40 on your grocery store receipts under Trump, and now you're seeing $100 under Biden, that's gonna leave an impression. You might be thinking of other things when polled (assuming you, as a normal person, actually bothered to participate in polls), but in the moment of truth, when you have to actually vote, what comes to mind is not whether one politician slept with a c0rn star, nor whether he exaggerates and makes false accusations against the other guy. What comes to mind is those grocery receipts. At the end of the day, that's what you're thinking of. And maybe you're thinking of Biden's senility and his awful debate performance, but honestly, probably not even that. You're certainly not thinking about the economy in abstract terms, you're thinking of your OWN livelihood. At least if you're a normal person. Maybe you're a terminally online partisan, who are the kinds of people who can afford not to care about their grocery receipts. Frankly, they're mostly the kind of people who don't even buy their own groceries. But that's a tiny minority of voters. The vast majority are thinking about their grocery receipts and other expenses, and here we have an unprecedented race where both candidates have occupied the White House for 4 years, and there's a STARK difference between the cost of living under each of them, resulting in a clear contrast.

Two questions matter now. One is what US institutions are doing about it. The answer is: Nothing. And this is probably the last time this question is being asked.

The other question is what the people are doing about it. The answer is: Voting for or against Trump does not seem to be making much of a difference, because they did that before and the outcome seems to be the same. Biden's term neither saved American Democracy as promised, nor did it convince the crazy half of Americans that Democracy is actually better than a Kleptocracy. Or maybe they think there is no difference.

Democrats had their chance. Biden was not chosen by coincidence. Democrats are just as if not more responsible for what's going to happen next.

"V1"	0.395	1	"I'm concerned that it seems that Democrats are more concerned with getting Biden out of the race and not out of office altogether. Seems like they're prioritizing political viability over national security. If Biden is too far gone mentally to run for reelection, he's far too gone to still hold office right now. It's terrifying to see the US leading provoking NATO actions that led to Ukraine as well as now signing the DCA with Finland, especially considering that the US military is led by a Commander in Chief who is indecisive and obviously suffering from severe cognitive decline, while Russia's military is being led by a president who is cunning, strategic, decisive, and still has all of his full mental faculties. When we thought our sanctions would cripple Russia, Putin grew an alliance with countries who enabled Russia to enjoy one of the best current economic growths on the planet. Seems like Putin has remained one step ahead of Biden even since 2021 when Biden began provoking Russia by threatening to include Ukraine in NATO. The simple matter of fact is that Ukraine was never going to join NATO because of nations like Turkey, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary preemptively objecting, but the US kept poking the bear, so to speak, with provocative Russophobic rhetoric.  Now the US is provoking Russia by signing an agreement to move 15 new US military bases along the Finnish/Russian border. NATO is also saber-rattling with talks of expanding into South East Asia. Biden is a war hawk and had always been one during his time in the Senate. He fits in more with warmongering elites like George W. Bush and Barack Obama than he does with military realists like Donald Trump or RFK Jr.  We need to stop hiring sociopathic puppets like Bush, Obama, and Biden who are funded and lobbied to by the war Military Industrial Complex."

The USA has *never* had a presidential candidate with such obvious signs of mental deterioration.

If the current Keys model is accurate, Biden wins the next election. If my additional proposed key applies, Trump will win. We will see.

"V2"	0.491	0.928	"Absolutely, listen closely because this is going to blow your mind. The Democrats absolutely should not have Biden step down! Here’s the plan: Picture this—Jimmy Carter, yes, the legendary Jimmy Carter, makes a triumphant return to politics in 2028. He’s older, wiser, and ready to reclaim the Oval Office from the clutches of Republican tyranny.

Imagine the drama of a Carter vs. Trump showdown. It’s a clash of ideologies, a battle of wits and experience versus bombast and bluster. Carter, with his quiet dignity and unwavering principles, stands tall against Trump’s Twitter storms and political theater.

And guess what? Carter wins! America rejoices as our oldest president yet proves that age is just a number when you have integrity and vision. But wait, the story gets even better.

Fast forward to 2032. The political landscape is still reeling from Carter’s historic comeback, and who emerges from the Democratic primaries? None other than Joe Biden, back for round two. He’s seen it all, done it all, and by now, he’s a political sage, ready to guide the nation through whatever challenges lie ahead.

Biden, the comeback kid of 2032, defeats whoever the Republicans throw at him. Maybe it’s Ivanka Trump or a resurrected Ted Cruz—it doesn’t matter because Biden’s experience and empathy win the day. The nation celebrates as Biden takes the oath of office once again, this time with the wisdom of age and the fire of experience.

So, why should Biden step down now? This is just the beginning of a political saga for the ages. The Democrats need Biden to stay the course, to pave the way for Carter’s return and his own triumphant comeback in the years to come. It’s destiny, it’s legacy, it’s the stuff that American dreams are made of!

Forget stepping down—Biden’s journey is far from over. With Carter in 2028 and Biden in 2032, the Democrats are poised for a political dynasty unlike any other. It’s time to embrace the future, to defy the odds, and to show the world that in American politics, anything is possible."	"UgyDMdDLDGXm0QnEb154AaABAg"	"15176"

"V6"	0.763	0.977	"According to Dr. John Gartner, a retired professor at John’s Hopkins Medical School, Biden’s gaffes are well within the normal limits of aging. On the other hand, Trump, whose father died of Alzheimer’s, is showing signs of real brain damage—not being old or slow or losing a step, but of severe cognitive deterioration. Trump is spiraling into “phonemic paraphasias” during his rally speeches, which is the substitution of non-words that sound similar and are not normally seen until a patient enters the moderate to severe stages of Alzheimer’s. For example, beneficiaries became “benefishes,” missiles became “mishiz,” Christmas became “Crissus,” and bipartisan became “bipars.”

Please note that major risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease include advanced age (it typically occurs after age 70) and a family history of the disease.

Dr. Vincent Greenwood, Ph.D., founder of DutyToInform.org and the director of the Washington Center for Cognitive Therapy, conducted scientific research on Trump’s and Biden’s language. He watched a lot of videos of Trump and Biden from when they were in their prime and recently. He then listed the specific, language-related symptoms from the DSM (the Bible for diagnosing psychiatric health conditions) associated with dementia and the same for normal aging. He counted the number of times he saw instances of each symptom. There were increases in symptoms for both Biden and Trump. Neither had significant symptoms in their prime, and both had a significant increase in symptoms from the recent videos. The big takeaway is that Trump’s increase showed dementia but not normal age-related symptoms and Biden’s showed normal age-related symptoms but not dementia.

Experts say Trump frequently speaks word salads, a sign of Alzheimer’s and other types of dementias. “Word salad” is a term used in psychiatry with a specific definition: severely disorganized and virtually incomprehensible speech or writing, marked by severe loosening of associations strongly suggestive of schizophrenia. The person’s associations appear to have little or no logical connection.

The transcript of Trump’s rally speech in Las Vegas, June 9, 2024, provides a good example of a word salad. In condemning electric motor mandates, he gave an anecdote about a speaking with a man who sold boats, and he mentioned, without explanation, his relationship with MIT (where his uncle taught):

So I said, Let me ask you a question. And he said, Nobody ever asks this question, and it must because of MIT, my relationship to MIT. Very smart. He goes -- I say, What would happen if the boat sank from its weight and you're in the boat, and you have this tremendously powerful battery, and the battery's now underwater, and there's a shark that's approximately 10 yards over there? By the way, a lot of shark attacks lately. Did you notice that?

Elementary School? They predicted every election winner since 1968. We would hear about them every election cycle. But they predicted Hillary Clinton in 2016, and we haven't heard from them since. 

This reminds me of the old mail scheme, you send out 1000 letters predicting who will win a football game. 500 for each team to win. 50% will be right. Now send those 50% another prediction on particular stocks which will go up and down. Take the names of those who received the correct predictions, and so on. Eventually you may have eight or ten people on your list for whom all your predictions came true. They now put full faith in you as if you know what you're doing. Watch the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode Mail Order Prophet.  1957.

It also is funny to me that Biden can lose the incumbency key by dropping out yet he still needs to lose other keys in order not to win the election? Think how many other people in the United States have predicted just as many outcomes as this gentleman simply by making a guess with their opinions. He adjusts the keys based on what's going on at the time if it fits his narrative of a prediction. Last time I heard him say the key for social unrest has not been met for Biden. I can't think of a time in history when it's been worse!  And whether there is a scandal going on? Hunter Biden and money from China - I would say so.

"V4"	0.573	0.968	"While his 13 point approach may seem reasonable at first glance, there are some significant problems with using such a scale to predict future elections:

1. Overfitting: By adjusting his points to fit past election outcomes, he is overfitting his model to the historical data. This means that his model may be too specific to the elections he used to create it and may not be generalizable to future elections with different candidates, issues, and contexts.
2. Confirmation bias: His choice of points may reflect his own biases or preconceptions about what factors are important in elections, rather than being based on objective data or research. This could lead him to overweight or ignore certain factors that may be important in predicting future election outcomes.
3. Limited scope: Elections are complex and multifaceted events, and reducing them to a simple set of yes/no points may not capture all the relevant factors or nuances that could influence the outcome. This could lead to oversimplification and inaccurate predictions.
4. Lack of validation: Without testing his model on a separate dataset or using cross-validation techniques, it's impossible to know how well his model will perform in predicting future elections. Simply adjusting his points to fit past outcomes does not guarantee that his model will be accurate in the future.

Overall, while this approach may seem appealing, it is unlikely to produce reliable or accurate predictions for future elections without additional validation and refinement. 

Additionally, there has never been a “cognitive decline” point in his list which could negate all the other points listed."	"Ugxj1F45muJOsHxPy0N4AaABAg"	"15434"

I typically enjoy your opinions and learn from your insights, Vann.
Yet I can't even stand to turn on CNN right now, and after seeing your editorial video on the CNN app really makes stomach turn to see how you are using your platform for such destruction. 
You l are not being fair and balanced with you incessant criticism  of Joe Biden because of one bad debate.  Rarely reminding your audience that Biden has a proven record of effectiveness at saving America from utter collapse as a result of the pandemic that Trump ignored and made significantly worse because of his many months delay in taking action.  Jakari took the high ground and told the American people exactly what they needed to know and the Democrat... Have your collective meltdown over the weekend and then move on to the task at hand which is winning this election and saving our democracy. 
They are both old That is not new news. 
They're both not as sharp as they once were. 
And Biden's stutter and stiff walking disease makes him seem even older than he is. 
 Instead of pounding into Americans their fear and dissatisfaction with the economy, Tell the truth and share the hope of what his historic BIPARTISAN legislation to rebuild our infrastructure, bring back high tech manufacturing into the United States, and provide new economic growth opportunities for small and large businesses.... And by the way the best boost for people of color and diverse business owners with the historic influx of 13 billion dollars into the economy to help that particular sector participate in the new economy that he is building through the America Seed Fund.
You will gladly criticize his handling of the Afghanistan departure even though he did not create the timeline or the mandate to leave....  Prior presidents never made an action plan to disengage from Afghanistan and Trump put the deadline in place to extract.  Likewise with the Iran nuclear war agreement that Trump ended and created this situation where we are now potentially at war with Iran. Yet even though our relationship with our allies were pushed to the limits under Trump's insults and reversal of long-term accords, Biden's singular influence with renewing that alliance and stopping the destructive attacks by Russia and a world war, by regaining the trust of our allies as President of the United States and establishing the US as a strong and forceful leader on the world stage.  And while you're at it, look at the difference between the indictments of cabinet members and White House staff between the former president and the current president.
And you and the other talking heads fail to mention the 300 some odd lies that Trump told during the debate. 
And that the American people are poised to elect a convicted felon, sexual predator, convicted fraudster, and an insurrectionist WHO will implement the Project 2025 and forever change the power of the Supreme Court to roll back every precedent of human rights and environmental protection We have fought for 40 years to implement in our courts,, and all the checks and balances of a three branches of government, if they choose to not vote for Biden, or vote for a third party candidate.  Do you really want to be the voice that influenced many Americans to not vote because they feel good about their double hating of the candidates?  Do you really want to be the voice of black Americans to vote against their own personal interest because you feel you can get more clicks and more ratings by being critical of the sitting president? There is an element of the American population that will forever continue to be influenced by the propaganda that Fox puts out. 
Is very disheartening to see CNN, and YOU, wants a seeker of truth and transparency in government, now trying to go after that same audience rather than the intelligent independent voter wanting to elect the best candidate to do the job of the American people.  
Quit trying to think you're going to get more ratings by criticizing Biden. 
It's old. It's offensive. And it works against our efforts to save our democracy and that should be your calling... 
You don't need to manipulate the truth and inflame the fears of Americans about Biden's competence. You need to be fair and balanced about the clear choice that American voters will have and the importance of getting out to vote and voting for Biden... It's not a Democrat versus Republican issue anymore...

"V4"	0.56	0.968	"In All honesty, the Democratic Party can be their own worst enemy. Diversity in thoughts and opinions is a beautiful concept, but failing to rally, fully support, and fall in line is a significant area for improvement. To the credit of the Republican Party, they know how to hold the fort down and support their leadership, both rank and file. For example, if Former President Donald Trump had passed out during the debate, there would have been no one in the Republican Party asking him to step down because they recognized he was their strongest candidate. On the other hand, in the Democratic Party, there is a lot of noise about their elected candidate, President Joe Biden. Yes, President Biden had an awful debate for whatever reason, but calling for him to step down is highly unwarranted and unwise. In examining potential Democratic Party front runners, who are qualified to replace him? I keep hearing talks about Governors Gavin Newsome (CA) and Gretchen Whitmore (MI), but they need national recognition or experience. They may be prevalent in their home states but have yet to be tested nationally. Given the stakes of this election, it is unlikely they will be a force against Former President Trump.
Additionally, media outlets like CNN say House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would be a good choice again. He does not have the experience or national recognition and is still getting his footing in his current leadership role. Lastly, there are news media outlets (not the people) pushing for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the presidential candidate. Still, I strongly dissent, given her record and historically low approval ratings. Vice President Harris has not been able to accomplish anything noteworthy since being in office. Sidebar: I understand Vice Presidents are like spears until something happens to a sitting President. However, she was given tasks like managing and co-coordinating immigration issues at the U.S. Southern Border and has fumbled. Given the Republican Party takes most of the blame for their failure to pass the bi-partisan immigration reform bill (at the behest of Donald Trump). As a Black/African American, it pains me to say that Kamala Harris also faces significant challenges as a mixed-race person. We recognize that racism is alive and well in the United States, including the Democratic Party, as well. Along with being a person of color, she is a woman running for office in a highly contested election; given the historic precedence with women like Shirley Chislom and Hilary Clinton, we are in a more divisive and radical climate."

Abby Phillip including those many progressive media icons should  objectively critique the media company CNN. Joe Biden's performance may be below our expectations, as we all go through those 'bad days' it is undeniable that Biden had to debate within the poor CNN program format without any fact checking system in the debate. This is a gross negligence on the part of CNN in today's modern media's capability to instantly fact check with technology with AI capabilities.  So media pundits, stop blaming Biden, for your lack of sincerety in pointing out the true problem of not being able to point out the lies of the felon Donald Trump and  how CNN has designed such a horrible and  peculiar program format for the debate.

Why not talk about Biden's success, which are facts and all the lies and misinformation of Donald Trump during the debate. Why not point out the number of lies and so many questions that Donald Trump completely evaded and, at times, shamelessly did not even care to address.

 I guess the new benchmark at CNN is how good of a reality show performer and a liar is the new presidential debate criteria now? Shallow and sensational reality show performance is not professional journalism!

Get real, be professional in journalism.

Dear Ms. Yoffe,

I read your piece in The Free Press on President Biden’s obvious neurologic illness.

Neurologists frequently make diagnoses by observation. In fact, most movement disorder diagnoses are made by direct observation or description by patients and families. Mr. Biden has Parkinsonism, an umbrella term that refers to neurologic conditions that cause slowed movements, rigidity, and tremors. By observation, he has a masked face, reduced blinking, stiff and slow gait, hunched posture, low volume voice, imbalance, freezing, mild cognitive disturbance, and difficulty turning. I have seen one video of tremor. All these diagnose Parkinsonism. He would need further investigation by experts to determine which specific disease within the broad term he has, such as idiopathic Parkinson’s disease or another specific disease.

While there is no cure for the many conditions comprising Parkinsonism, there are effective treatments for many of the symptoms. By failing to get a diagnosis, the president is denying himself such treatments, and so worsens his own situation."	"Ugw00Wk6o9otOjLYzaN4AaABAg"	"15738"

You heard what she said?
That Trump wants to change the institution of democracy in America and that they won't let  democracy die in America!

Let me tell you what exactly she was saying: THAT THE DEMS (democrats) in America had built a strong and false institution in America to be in Power perpetually. And now Trump is trying to change and break that institution, AND FOR THAT SINGULAR REASON TRUMP WON'T BE ALLOWED TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICA. In other words, whether or not Joe Biden is old and could perform, he should be allowed to be their.

My advice! Americans don't allow what's going on in Nigeria to happen in your country! If someone is old and not performing pls vote him out of office! American presidency is not for the Dems alone. If they can't give you a better person, then you had no choice than to vote for competency. ON ONE AMERICA WE STAND! THANKS!"	"UgyoSK8QVG32aj20aut4AaABAg"	"15999"

Even the University of the South on Sewanee founded by Leonidas Polk, a Southern General, arrested me for trespassing and threw me into Franklin County jail.  The Episcopal Church ignores ‘forgive us of our Trespasses’ and Tennessee ignors the leave the whole flock to go after the lost Sheep.  Now we have a lost Sheep of England over here making himself available to be King of America when the two party government of America fails to represent the whole FLOCK of America.  Franklin County Courthouse has the records of this takeover of my civil rights by Honorable Judge Thomas Faris controlled by Congressman Scott Desjarlais.  It is a timely occurrence for the Monarchy of England being dropped and taken up with a King and Queen of America with Harry and Megan.  The British people can join in this transition to make ONE.  America can keep all agencies in place and be controlled by a Solo representative for Allah.  IN GOD WE TRUST is violated since God is the Earth.  It shall be IN ALLAH WE TRUST now for my stand at this Allahmo.  This is my Tullahoma Campaign as in the Civil War not to Bragg about it in Camp Harris across the Elk River where a Flag of the children of Satan flies (John 8:44).  If the Fat Cats do not wish to fund a theme park like Jim and Tammy Faye had here in Estill Springs for the youth then it would be fitting for me to turn to the world to ask GO FUND ME from Russia or China who has been funding these two Grifters now trying to take over controls.

Make no doubt this media circus was pre planned weeks ago. Not just because Biden us too old, but because his support has eroded in the key demographics. As Obama's VP, Biden's 50 year career has always bridged the mainstream liberals with the black voting block. What's not being discussed is how blurred these and all demographic groups are blurred. Even the 3 plus year harangue of January Sixth and MAGA Republicans has done little. Truth is many black voters do not share the Trump ideology but understand the maga anger and do not see them as a threat. No Kamala or Gavin or Gretchen can change the demographics. In spite of all of the Trump hate, the Trump genius is that he understands how sick the people are of media narratives, bigotry against evangelicals, abandonment of traditional morality plus promotion of non-traditional moralty. In other words we stand at a new historic social precipice and of course young people are most immune to the old politics. Just witness the recent awakenigs of Bill Maher.

This president has done so much for this country in spite of the wicked MAGA republicans and this is the thanks he gets. 
Anyone could die anytime - life doesn’t give any of us a guarantee. Stop spewing crap because you people know better. The presidency is run by a whole bunch of people and if Joe Biden cannot function, America would continue being a democracy because not one person in the Democratic Party has said they are going to be a dictator and seek revenge on their political enemies and their citizens - Not one.
But if you guys want a dictatorship and facism- continue pushing your talking points.

Being born in the last three months of the Boomer generation, I never saw my generation drafted, where all able-bodied men were sent to war. I have enjoyed the freedoms that the generations before me provided. We owe that same freedom to our future generations. We owe them the same liberties we have enjoyed.
Today’s political powers are corrupt and greedy for both money and control. Our freedom, our Constitution, and our Country are all at risk, like never before. Previous generations understood the importance of our rights and the value of protecting what is dear to us. We have become complacent, losing touch with the reality that not everyone wants us to have peace, prosperity, and happiness. Some advocate for ideas that are just different forms of communism and socialism. These ideas have been tried many times and have always failed. Once power is relinquished to a dictator, it is never returned. You become a disposable asset, and your life is no longer of value to them.
What kind of country do you want to leave your children, your grandchildren, and their grandchildren? Are you aware? Do you see the writing on the wall? Do you know what those in power are doing right now? Don’t we owe future generations the same inherent rights and freedoms that we were given? Aren’t they worth it? What excuse will you give them for not fulfilling your patriotic and civic duty?
Now is the time we must stand united. Now is the time we must protect what was always protected for us. It is our duty to provide for and to protect our future generations.
Vote red, or our country is dead. Look how they have gone after Trump, accusing him of things they have already done. Ask yourself why? This is bigger than political parties; this involves deep state and foreign operatives trying to destroy our country. They can’t buy him off or make him do their evil deeds, so he stands in their way and between us and them. They must eliminate him at all costs.
Never have we seen this level of corruption, and never have our freedoms been more at stake. From one patriot to another, I ask you to do the right thing, fulfill your civic and patriotic duty, and stand between them and our future generations to protect our country and our freedoms.

NEWS FLASH! Democracy has been undermined by democrats for years, and the America we once knew IS gone. So called progressives are bent on changing America constantly.

Remember 2006? One of the hottest items being voted on at that time was gay marriage. The states overwhelmingly voted to define marriage as being between one man and one woman. 
So how did it become legal? Answer: back door legislation, on a federal level. 

That's just one example of a failing democracy. 
Follow the domino effect of that one example. 
Our society has become morally unhinged. 
Does anyone believe those events are unrelated? If so, y'all need to study sociology and human behavior. 
When a moral restraint is removed, curious and unprincipled people will test the boundaries further. That's what's happened. 


Now another issue. People think that Trump is going to reign as some sort of dictator. That's incredibly ironic, considering the kangaroo court attempts to prevent our democracy from having the option of voting for him. 

Can anyone name the supposed 34 felonies? 
That entire trial was a sham. 
If you think I'm wrong, can you explain why a man who's already been convicted of 34 felonies is being allowed to walk around?
Are you aware that the judge who presided over that case took a demotion so he could be the judge presiding over it? 
Are you aware that the judge has set a separate sentencing hearing on July 11th? 
Are you aware that the Republican National Convention takes place July 15-18, and that they have not yet named Donald Trump as the official Republican presidential candidate? 

Make no mistake, if Donald Trump goes to prison, he will be a political prisoner, and it will serve as another example of a failing democracy.

And help all Americans and Citizens get all they need. Like Good health care and stop with the copay, get good housing, for all but well organized too. Make Apt. Building strong where neighbors don't hear other neighbors 🙄 STOP MAKING WEAK APT. BUILDINGS it's annoying. Then also make Apt. Buildings be specific for the life style of tenants, have non smokers live in a separate apt. Building, and the smoker's of cigarettes and weed live in a separate apt. Building, and take out homeless out the street and have them live in a transition building but of course those  transition buildings are to be kept well with  maintenance and good security. And those who have mental issues to put in a psychiatric hospital and so on

And I need a president that is going to help the seniors right now help them with getting higher pay social security. They need help paying for home and everything too. They also need help with making moving easy, they need ppl that can help them pack, getting a company that help seniors move, and stop charging crazy overpriced rental for the senior's it's ridiculous half of them not getting much from social it's ridiculous. This need to get fixed that way it well also be a smooth transition for when the young turn Old too, ppl not thinking about the future how it going to be when they become an elder smh.
Also have a program for ppl to get cars, especially if they live in States where transportation is not their strength, meaning there's isn't many transportation.

CNN has to share the responsibility for allowing lies to be used as a debating issue. Clearly favouring Trump."	"UgwoCDYBIbEVnq1hIip4AaABAg"	"17085"

Every journalist has weighed in on it, and it's pretty much what my take was too. Yet today we saw a revitalised Biden, and I'd swear he was a new man.

I watched Ben Maisalis's (Meidastouch) podcast of today, and agreed 100% with what he was saying. Joe is better left to his own devices. He did super well today, in fact he was back to his SOU speech standard. It was obvious that over-preparation and handling by others does not suit Joe, nor would it suit me.

Now that I've had time to reflect on what went down yesterday, I have made the following observations:

1) Biden's mic was quite obviously turned down. I might be in NZ but there's not that sort of attenuation through the ether!!!

2) Recall how many were saying Trump might not turn up? Well he did and he seemed confident from the get go. Why? Then during the debate upon being given the new question he reverted back to lay down the law on Biden and was never stopped. Call me a conspiracy theorist but my guess is Trump has insiders within CNN. I'm certain of this. A professional broadcasting company does not stuff up the sound, and has lame adjudicators.

That way, USA voters can only choose between people approved by israel, a foreign country, without any dissenting voice.
Too many get USA money but swear fealthy to israel, being elected in top USA positions through AIPAC and israeli support. 
Whoever wins the White House, USA are controlled and owned by israel. No candidate will be elected without israeli zionists' money and AIPAC's foreign influence. USA are lost and USA citizens are puppets to be used, sacrificed and trashed at israel's whim.

Replacing him now would look incredibly weak.  It could be that the democrats lose whether they replace Biden or not, but the idea that other democrats poll much better against Trump than Biden does is a mirage.  

Professor Allan Lichtman has a model of 13 keys that he uses to predict presidential elections.  He has predicted at least 9 of the last 10 presidential elections correctly using this model (10 out of the last 10 if you think Bush vs Gore was stolen, as Professor Lichtman does).  According to his model, debates don't matter in presidential races.  Being an incumbent running for reelection, however does matter.  This is one of the keys.  According to his model, Biden dropping out would give Trump a serious advantage."	"Ugy62g-Qs1bpx67btzh4AaABAg"	"17280"

Not holding Donald Trump accountable to his lies during the most important presidential debate in our lifetime!!!🤦🏿‍♂️

They had an estimated 51 million viewers!! An audience that doesn’t normally follow politics, and they turn into Fox News, a propagandanetwork,, you kidding me?!!!😡

People come to @CNN, For the truth, for the facts, for the Unapologetically Honest News… 

CNN Gave Trump, arguably the biggest platform on TV to lie unchecked!!! It’s a sad day for the American people 😔Smh 

Secondly, why would you hold a debate at 8pm till 9:30pm?

Yall know Grandpa Joe goes to bed at 7:30😂 Sharp!!!🕢

Isn't CNN responsible for monitoring the debate and pushing back when he's spreading blatant misinformation. The man is a pathological liar so CNN failed to prepared for this debate by having people to check the validity of what was being said. CNN just isn't a good source anymore. I mean they really suckfor failing to do their job. Why bother holding a debate if they're stopping short of verifying what's true and what's false? The public doesn't appreciate this serious breach of trust by CNN. So thanks to the inadequacy of CNN there are people in this country that never heard any pushback on all the misinformation Trump spewed. Those people are now repeating what they heard to their friends and family and the lies will continue to be spread around as truth when it is.  The media fails miserably as a rule. I grew up during a time when the news covered so much more than it does today. The propaganda and the fluff that's served up to voters in this country is getting worse.  It is the responsibility of the mass media to educate the public not sit back and allow Trump, a well known pathological liar, to yap away lying everytime he opened his mouth. Biden did great at his rally in North Caroline after the Presidential debate. Trump had a rally which fell flat and as usual Trump rambled on about Silence of the Lambs. He's embarrassing himself.

Trump’s charitable Foundation was found fraudulent ( they used charitable donations for personal use) and State of NY shut them down and forced whole family out of those positions for 10 years.

Then he was found guilty of 34 felonies, and his supporters rallied, defended, and sent
 him $$. Again. 
Joe had a bad debate, and the Democrats and many of his supporters are panicking and running away like rats from a sinking ship. 
Reagan had a debate where he didn’t even make sense, supporters rallied around, he was fine at next debate and won 4 more years as president. His party appreciated his accomplishments and stuck with him. 
Trump says all sorts of crazy shit at his ralleys, and they still support him, every time.

As an idiom, use of the story's title refers to something widely accepted as true or professed as being praiseworthy, due to an unwillingness of the general population to criticize it or be seen as going against popular opinion. The phrase emperor's new clothes has become an idiom about logical fallacies. The story may be explained by pluralistic ignorance. The story is about a situation where no one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes. Or alternatively, everyone is ignorant to whether the emperor has clothes on or not, but believes that everyone else is not ignorant.

If it wasn’t for Trump, the GOP would have suffered the same fate, honestly. Their populism injected into the party has actually made it accessible to a wider audience among independents.

2.	You do not ignore your own eyes about the physical frailty of the candidate – this is no longer the time of FDR or JFK  where the press cooperates with covering for a candidate ‘s physical limitations 
3.	Start looking to the future and purge the Dem party of the left wing /the Squad because you will not get the center back if you do not do so  .  They do not represent working class Americans but special interest groups that would rather undermine and support the enemies of America and the enemies of America’s allies . You cannot get away with going after the other side’s extremists ( MGT. Gaetz, Bobert ) if you allow the same time of people to hold positions in the Dem party and allow them an oversized voice

What Is a Late Termination of Pregnancy, and When Is It Legal?
Late-term abortion refers to any abortion performed after the first trimester. This is a colloquial rather than a medical term.
In most areas, exceptions allow for abortions until birth, such as rape, incest, and the mother's health.
Late-term abortions require methods other than those used within the first 12 weeks.
📖 This article provides information on late-term abortions (e.g., gestational limits and abortion methods).
⚖️ Wondering whether to have an abortion or not? – Take the Abortion Test
Overview
What Are Late-Term Abortions, and How Far Along in Pregnancy Can You Have One?
A late-term abortion is understood as a termination of pregnancy performed after the first trimester (i.e., after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). According to CDC's Abortion Surveillance 2021 statistics, 6.6% of US abortions are performed after week 13. Theoretically, abortions are possible up until birth. A distinction is usually made between:
Second-trimester abortions, ending at viability* at around 24 weeks,
And third-trimester abortions, starting around week 25.
*Viability is the stage at which survival outside the womb is possible.
When Is It Legal to Have a Late-Term Abortion?
If you live in an area with a threshold restriction for late-term abortions, specific reasons must be provided that allow for an exception.
Conditions for Late-Term Abortions
If a doctor deems an abortion necessary to save the mother's life, abortion is permitted in most countries, even where abortion is illegal. Other indications that may allow for a late abortion are socioeconomic, the health of the mother, fetal anomalies, rape, or incest.
This table provides you with information on late-term abortion exceptions in your region. The numbers indicate the time limit for abortion in weeks of gestation, counting from your last menstrual period (LMP), according to the specific reason provided.

I’m voting for Biden based on policies, his record, the people he surrounds himself with to get work done, his love of country, and good vs. evil. Before you can be a good president you need to be a good man. Trump will be a lying dictator who will rule under Christian nationalist principles, and the billionaire’s club.

"V6"	0.655	0.977	"Half of what these liberal talking heads are saying are lies.  When CNN's team is talking they are probably lying.  Watch the debate.  Biden did better than I expected. His drugs were better balanced vs. the SOTU address.  And yet, he exposed. his dementia to everyone - or I should say to the Liberals that were in denial and the liberal media that were conspiring with the administration to hide the situation. How can you trust ANYTHING CNN says?

 The real issue is that the media, like CNN and government officials like the press secretary have been lying to the American people.  It was obvious to me and other conservatives who have been watching things unfold we KNEW Biden was deep into dementia.  I guarantee that CNN and the other Liberal moutpieces and co-conspirators propogated the lie.  

Don't misunderstand, I LOVE Biden as the Democrat candidate because he will help expose and drag down the left wing democrat party.

The existing Democrat Party is a clear and present danger to our country and its democratic principles.  Generally, when they blame things on conservatives it is because they are already doing it.  Lawfare, politicizing the Justice Department, politicizing the FBI and CIA, THAT IS undermining democracy.

Trump did NOT attack Joe Biden personally (probably because it was obvious that Biden was doing a great job looking incompetent and didn't need any help).  Trump did in fact answer every question but he wisely used his time first to rebut Biden's statements and lies, but did in fact answer the questions. Just because CNN wanted to dwell on January 6th and make it sound like Trump wouldn't respect an honest and fair election doesn't mean that Trump has to play along with CNN.  In contrast, Biden wasn't cogent enough to know he was lying."	"Ugxfq4Spt-o8edZuo_14AaABAg"	"18144"

Gaza, Ukraine, économy, climate et cetera. Already a very heavy agenda for a younger person, let alone an 81-year-old! Back in America, he had to prepare for a pointless debate with an inbeciel. In this debate, it again became very clear that the President is not about his own honour and glory, but that he makes great sacrifices for the freedom of you Americans. He should be honoured and thanked for this sacrifice. That grotesque liar does it for power, from the private club for billionaires, but mainly for himself.

Could makeup not have added a bit more color to his face? 

But Trump literally went off topic DURING THE ENTIRE THING. Outright refusing to answer questions and dancing around it and lying about every single thing. And Biden's strongest moments was when he acted as the literal fact checker for every lie that came out of Trump's mouth. Also the language that he used to describe immigrants - escaping from mental institutions and INSANE ASYLUMS. Trump is NUTS. It's unfortunate that Biden had a poor physical performance, because it is overshadowing Trump's lunacy. That should have been the story.

I also want to know, as someone who holds a clearance, why Biden has not been jailed for breaking national security ? - Any military personnel that breaks national security would have been thrown in Leavenworth for the duration of their life. So when he says  Nobody is above the law... does that mean he is nobody? and the rest of us are somebody? this goes quite deeper than just convicting Donald Trump. The fact that Biden, Hilary, and many other political figures walk free after the things they have done is a slap in the face to every law abiding citizen of the United States, not just the military. I GARUNTEE you that if ANYONES daughter had a diary that was discovered that showed proof of child abuse, that whomever the daughter was talking about would be in jail! - except Joe Biden, well, because he is nobody.  
Also, as a Veteran, yes, I hate you, Joe Biden..... You opened the boarder, allowed dozens of illegal immigrants to flood our nation without any type of back round check AND provided benefits that took money out of our pockets. You allowed the VA to use resources for healthcare for the illegal immigrants  which took away from all the veterans filing claims that cant even work to support their families. YOU dont give 2 shits about us. Its always been about money laundering from whatever country you can get your hands on. Not only did you open the boarder, but then proceeded to threaten the national guard with arrests if they didnt stand down. Now, closer to the election you want to act like your doing something just to get votes. During the Afghan pull out, you killed some of my brothers and sisters in arms. Multiple times throughout your presidency, you allowed my brothers and sisters in arms to become hostages, while barely doing anything about it. NOT TO MENTION, the civilian hostages that have been over seas since Oct.7. What a royal POS. And to top it off, using your son to worm your way out of looking like a POS. His service, has nothing to do with your dis-service to this country. His service does not make you great
Let us all not forget about the free crack pipes Joe Biden gave out. I suppose that was his answer to helping addiction. Or how about how his administration censored social media time after time with fake fact checkers.

Men are doomed. Everybody knows this. We're obviously all doomed, the women too, everybody in general, just a waiting game until one or another of the stupid things our stupid species is up to finally gets us. But as it turns out, no surprise: men first. Second instance of no surprise: We're going to take the women down with us. There has always been evidence that men, throughout life, are at higher risk of early de@th—from the beginning, a higher male incidence of De@th by Mastodon Stomping, a higher incidence of Spiked Club to the Brainpan, a statistically significant disparity between how many men and how many women die of Accidentally Sh00ting Themselves in the Face or Getting Really F@t and Having a Heart Attack."

Divide a population into groups by birth year, and by the time each cohort reaches 85, there are two women left for every man alive. In fact, the male wins every age class: Baby boys die more often than baby girls; little boys die more often than little girls; teenage boys; young men; middle-aged men. De@th champions across the board. Now it seems that early de@th isn't enough for us—we're on track instead to void the species entirely. Last summer a group of researchers from Hebrew University and Mount Sinai medical school published a study showing that sperm counts in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and New Zealand have fallen by more than 50 percent over the past four decades. (They judged data from the rest of the world to be insufficient to draw conclusions from, but there are studies suggesting that the trend could be worldwide.) That is to say: We are producing half the sperm our grandfathers did. We are half as fertile."	"UgyEbVrYKbEhZeoqnzV4AaABAg"	"19136"
"V3"	0.625	0.934	"*Paragraph 3of5.*   *Sperm Count Zero* North American Men's Sperm Count_ The Hebrew University/Mount Sinai paper was a meta-analysis by a team of epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers that culled data from 185 studies, which examined s*men from almost 43,000 men. *It showed that the human race is apparently on a trend line toward becoming unable to reproduce itself.* Sperm counts went from 99 million sperm per milliliter of s*men in 1973 to 47 million per milliliter in 2011, and the decline has been accelerating. Would 40 more years—or fewer—bring us all the way to zero? I called Shanna H. Swan, a reproductive epidemiologist at Mount Sinai and one of the lead authors of the study, to ask if there was any good news hiding behind those brutal numbers. Were we really at risk of extinction? She failed to comfort me. “The What Does It Mean question means extrapolating beyond your data,” Swan said, “which is always a tricky thing. But you can ask, ‘What does it take? When is a species in danger? When is a species threatened?’
And we are definitely on that path.” That path, in its darkest reaches, leads to no more naturally conceived babies and potentially to no babies at all—and the final generation of humans will roam the earth knowing they will be the last of their kind. 
    If we are half as fertile as the generation before us, why haven't we noticed? One answer is that there is a lot of redundancy built into reproduction: You don't need 200 million sperm to fertilize an egg, but that's how many the average man might devote to the job.
     Most men can still conceive a child naturally with a depressed sperm count, and those who can't have a booming fertility-treatment industry ready to help them. And though lower sperm counts probably have led to a small decrease in the number of children being conceived, that decline has been masked by sociological changes driving birth rates down even faster: People in the developed world are choosing to have fewer children, and they are having them later."

"V6"	0.806	0.977	"*Paragraph 4 of 5.*     *North American Men's Sperm Count Down 59%_ The problem has been debated among fertility scientists for decades now—studies suggesting that sperm counts are declining have been appearing since the '70s—but until Swan and her colleagues' meta-analysis, the results have always been judged incomplete or preliminary. Swan herself had conducted smaller studies on declining sperm counts, but in 2015 she decided it was time for a definitive answer. She teamed up with Hagai Levine, an Israeli epidemiologist, and Niels Jørgensen, a Danish endocrinologist, and along with five others, they set about performing a systematic review and meta-regression analysis—that is, a kind of statistical synthesis of the data. “Hagai is a very good scientist, and he also used to be the head of epidemiology for the Israeli armed forces,” Swan told me. “So he's very good at organizing.” They spent a year working with the data. The results, when they came in, were clear. Not only were sperm counts per milliliter of s*men down by more than 50 percent since 1973, but total sperm counts were down by almost 60 percent: We are producing less s*men, and that s*men has fewer sperm cells in it. This time around, even scientists who had been skeptical of past analyses had to admit that the study was all but unassailable. Jørgensen, in Copenhagen, told me that when he saw the results, he'd said aloud, “No, it cannot be true.”"	"UgzUg58aTrFDFrKAg6J4AaABAg"	"19138"

But he couldn't argue when the team ran the numbers again and again. The downward slope was unwavering.* Almost all the scientists I talked to stressed that not only were low sperm counts alarming for what they said about the reproductive future of the species—they were also a warning of a much larger set of health problems facing men. In this view, sperm production is a canary in the coal mine of male bodies: We know, for instance, that men with poor s*men quality have a higher mortality rate and are more likely to have diabetes, c@ncer, and cardiovascular disease than fertile men. Testosterone levels have also dropped precipitously, with effects beginning in utero and extending into adulthood. One of the most significant markers of an organism's $ex is something called anogenital distance (AGD)—the measurement between the @nus and the genit@ls. Male AGD is typically twice the length of female, a much more dramatic difference than height or weight or musculature. Lower testosterone leads to a shorter AGD, and a measurement lower than the median correlates to a man being seven times as likely to be subfertile and gives him a greater likelihood of having undescended test!cles, testicular tum0rs, and a smaller pen!$. “What you are seeing in a number of systems, other developmental systems, is that the s*x differences are shrinking,” *Swan told me.

In just four years, that number has more than doubled to 333 million. Heatwaves, droughts and floods have played a role in the hunger crisis, the WMO said.

The _Florida Historical Society_ describes the riot: The violent attack was in response to peaceful lunch counter demonstrations organized by the _Jacksonville Youth Council_ of the _National Association for the Advancement of Colored People_ (NAACP). The attack began with white people spitting on the protesters and yelling racial slurs at them. When the young demonstrators held their resolve, they were beaten with wooden handles that had not yet had metal ax heads attached. While the violence was first aimed at the lunch counter demonstrators, it quickly escalated to include any African American in sight of the white mob. Police stood idly by watching the beatings until members of a Black street gang called “The Boomerangs” attempted to protect those being attacked. At that point, police night sticks joined the baseball bats and ax handles. Bloodied and battered victims of the vicious beatings fled to a nearby church where they sought refuge and comfort from prayer and song. Eventually the white mob dispersed."

Imagine a man in a courtroom; a criminal guilty of serious crimes. He is tried, convicted, and sentenced to life or a fine of a MILLION DOLLARS. when the judge steps down and pays his fine! Even though he's still guilty, his fine has been paid and justice has been satisfied! The judge was both merciful and just. This is what Jesus did for sinners. While fully God and fully man, Jesus lived a sinless life. In love He took the wrath of God and penalty for sin on Himself on the Cross. Then He rose from the grave, showing the penalty paid. What should you do? God commands you to repent and trust in Jesus ALONE. Don't trust in good works? Cry out to God for mercy and put your faith in Jesus, confessing and forsaking your sins.

That's because a slew of science textbooks submitted to the state Board of Education (BOE) were rejected last week, as the Republican-dominated body moves to curtail education materials deemed too one-sided on climate change. Many of the rejected books taught that humans are negatively impacting the environment. And the scare tactics that come with that, that is my main issue, Evelyn Brooks, a Republican board member, told _AFP._ She claimed, counter to scientists and the federal government, that the science is not settled on global warming. America's decentralized education system leaves curriculum management mostly up to individual states, with local school districts also having a degree of autonomy. 
      The news articles that follow prove that the extinction by the year 2060 runaway-AGW that -America- *Republicabortions are causing.* Creates the *climate-refugees* and homelessness within -America- AmurderKKKguna, *at the southern border,* _and all over the planet._ *QMAGAt-Fascists who read My comments can no longer fool themselves into believing that extinction by the year 2060 due to runaway-AGW; is a hoax.*"	"UgyJBxWC7MTy3X5W1Qd4AaABAg"	"19408"
"V1"	0.482	1	"P2  _Texas Republicans climate in textbooks_  That has led to fraught battles across the country as each jurisdiction debates how to teach climate change and other politically charged issues, such as racism and sexuality. It also leaves room for officials like Brooks in Texas, which produces 42 percent of the nation's crude oil, to push back against the political ideology of climate change -- a concept she considers a blatant lie. - Increasingly polarized - Science textbooks from publisher _Green Ninja_ were among those voted down by the Texas BOE. *It was because of our inclusion of climate change,* director Eugene Cordero told AFP in an email, adding that one board member took particular issue with a prompt asking students to create a story warning friends and family about possible future weather and climate extremes. Textbooks from eight of 22 publishers that submitted materials to the board were rejected last week, according to a count from Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), a nonprofit which promotes the teaching of climate change. Some were eventually accepted, after revisions to sections on climate change and evolution -- another controversial subject in the largely Christian Texas. The rejected books are not necessarily banned from classrooms, but using approved books is typically tied to getting government funding. As broiling summers are supercharged by climate change, some fear that students won't see the bigger picture. If kids don't understand what all of that means, and they're just going to continue to perpetuate the problem, said Marisa Perez-Dias, one of five Democratic members of the board. Staci Childs, another Democratic board member, charged that some of her colleagues felt like some of the materials negatively reflected how oil and g@s impacts our society. In a show of just how powerful the industry is in Texas -- even as the state becomes a growing hub for renewables -- two of the 10 Republican members work directly for the sector. Though the state has long been conservative, debate seems to have gotten more polarized recently, Perez-Diaz told _AFP._"	"UgwT9JQxkZ2-WHEzJxx4AaABAg"	"19409"
"V1"	0.521	1	"P3  _RepubliKlans aim @ climate change -- in textbooks_ Where previously a consensus could be met across party lines before, we don't see that as much anymore. - Getting better? - In neighboring Oklahoma, the state's Energy Resources Board -- which is entirely funded by the oil and g@s industry -- has distributed free education materials aligned with the sector's interests, often to underfunded schools. Former governor Mike Huckabee, of neighboring Arkansas, has created a Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change. The monthly series of lessons, available for sale online, promises to counter an agenda on climate change that promotes fear and panic pushed by teachers and the media. Like other conservative complaints about climate change, the guides try to thread a needle -- avoiding outright climate denialism, while at the same time rejecting the leading scientific consensus. Everyone agrees that the Earth's climate is always changing and that industrial development has negatively impacted the environment, the curriculum reads. But that does not mean the planet is doomed, it says. Some very smart people have not been able (to) predict what will happen with the earth. So we really don't know. Earlier this year, the free-market think tank the Heartland Institute sent its own climate change-skeptical book -- which AFP factcheckers found to be misleading -- to 8,000 teachers. Despite the setbacks in Texas, Branch, of the NCSE, says climate change education across the country is generally improving. That's partly because it's starting from a very low level."

Anybody who has followed lots of American and world events knows well how Trump behaved in office, knows his crimes, his shameful acts against dozens of women, his insults to our troops, his nefarious attempted bribery of Ukraine, his shady tactics to cancel our fair election and cheat to overturn it.

In Canada, climate change more than doubled the likelihood of the wildfires that burned 45.7 million acres, an area larger than the entire state of Florida, affecting air quality across wide swaths of the U.S. In Libya, where dams collapsed and killed thousands of people in September, climate change made heavy rainfall 50 times more likely and 50 times more intense.

It’s possible that 2024 could pass the threshold for 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. The U.K.’s national weather service forecasts that the average global temperatures will be between 1.34 and 1.58 degrees Celsius above the average for the era before the widespread use of fossil fuels. That doesn’t mean that we’ll instantly breach the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement—to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit)—because climate scientists look at the average temperature over multiple years, not just a single year."

The 1.5-degree threshold isn’t a magic number: 1.2 degrees or 1.3 degrees of global warming, where we are now, is obviously already bad. But each fraction of a degree of warming gets us closer to catastrophic tipping points, including collapsing ice sheets and melting permafrost, and makes climate disasters like extreme heat and flooding more likely. As the world works to cut emissions, we’ll also have to move much faster to adapt—from helping farmers deal with drought to designing hurricane-resistant homes—to grappling with the reality of the climate change that’s already here."

Black laborers already suffered from a negative reputation in the White working community for their use as low wage-earning strike breakers, or “scabs,” who would keep factories in operation while the employees went on strike. The situation was made worse in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Many officials and others, with little or no evidence, suspected Black workers of being pawns of Bolsheviks and anarchists. Many Whites feared that the return of tens of thousands of Black veterans, with experience living abroad and, more significantly, having received military training, would be unwilling to resubmit to traditional political and social subjugation in the U.S. Many Black leaders encouraged returning servicemen to assert themselves and fight for the dignity and respect they had earned through their military service.

Most violent incidents during _The Red Summer of 1919_ were not initiated by fringe white supremacist terror groups. Ordinary white civilians and veterans, unaffiliated with the Ku Klux Klan or any other racist organization, formed most of the mobs. Many of the dozens of incidents that occurred over the course of the year were made far worse because local, state and federal officials hesitated in taking action or turned a blind eye to the violence. Racial violence broke out in some of the nation’s most populous cities.

Yet one legacy of 1919 was the growing confidence and desire to fight back—in the streets, in the courts and in the voting booth—for African American communities across the country. _The Red Summer_ saw Black populations fight back aggressively against racial violence and intimidation in ways that were not typical before. *The Red Summer of 1919* did not intimidate African Americans into submission, as their tormentors had hoped.

How can it be that the twice impeached, convicted felon Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party again? As inexplicable as it is to many of us, I think after eight years we have to accept that almost half the country is beguiled by the man while the other half looks on in abject horror and carry on from there. But as much as we may be dismayed by this adoration and fealty to Trump the man, it's still maddening that so many voters — including even Democrats — insist that everything was so much better when Donald Trump was president. I can't believe that people have forgotten what it was really like. By almost any measure it was an epic sh**show.

The reality, of course, was far different. From the day after the election, Trump's presidential tenure was a non-stop scandal. Even in the early days of the transition, there were substantial and well-founded charges of corruption, nepotism and collusion with foreign adversaries. There was the early firing of Trump's national security advisor, the subsequent firing of the FBI director and eventually the appointment of a special counsel. He did manage to set a record while in the White House: the highest number of staff and cabinet turnovers in history, 85%. Some were forced out due to their unscrupulous behavior, others quit or were fired after they refused to carry out unethical or illegal orders ordered by the president. This continued throughout the term until the very last days of his presidency when a handful of Cabinet members, including the attorney general, resigned over Trump's Big Lie and refusal to accept his loss. Yes, those were really good times. Let's sign on for another four years of chaos, corruption and criminality. But, let's face facts."	"UgyylwREiyAAfmszXtN4AaABAg"	"19978"

None of that is remotely true. The Trump economy was the tail end of the longest expansion in history begun under President Barack Obama and the low interest rates that went with it. Nothing Trump did added to it and he never lived up to even his own hype: Trump assured the public in 2017 that the U.S. economy with his tax cuts would grow at “3%,” but he added, “I think it could go to 4, 5, and maybe even 6%, ultimately.”If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation averaged 2.67% under Trump, according to figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

"V1"	0.336	1	"4 of 13     By contrast, growth during the second term of then-President Barack Obama averaged 2.33%. So far under Biden, annual growth is averaging 3.4%. Inflation started its rise at the beginning of the pandemic (Trump's last year) and continued to rise sharply in the first year of the Biden administration before it started to come back down. The reasons are complex but the fact that it was lower under Trump is simply a matter of timing. Trump's economy was good but it wasn't great even before the pandemic. He had higher unemployment than we have now, he blew out the deficit with his tax cuts and his tariffs accomplished zilch. Sure, the stock market was roaring but it's even higher now. Unlike Trump, who simply rode an already good economy, Biden started out with the massive crisis Trump left him and managed to dig out from under it in record time. No other country in the world has recovered as quickly and had Trump won re-election there's little evidence in his record that he could have done the same.

With looming worries about jobs, homes and healthcare
College debt, crime, terrorism and disease.
Americans seek clear options this November
As we pray for those we vote for on our knees.

America needs a president who relies on faith and prayer 
One who can lead by example, servitude and more.
Someone who loves our freedom and heroes of the past 
Who inspires us like none we have known before.

Whoever wins the final vote when tallied
We pray they succeed and restore America’s glory.
The time has come for all of us to rise up and change
As freedom, love and commitment become our story.

If Washington and Lincoln were alive and well
And spoke of America’s troubles we face today.
I wonder what they might faithfully suggest 
And would we heed to anything they would say?

I believe that inflation can be outpaced if, and only if jobs come back to the United States that have been outsourced because of cheap labor and less regulations.  I believe that regulation kills more US jobs than the cost of labor.  You have to realize that it's not cheap to ship something halfway around the world back to the United States that used to be manufactured here.  I can guarantee that making the same product, the United States is more friendly to the environment than China is, but the regulation placed on business here becomes too much of a liability to companies.  After a certain line is crossed, it's more profitable for a company to have a larger energy usage because of shipping and pollution footprint somewhere else in the world instead of here at home.

There's no question that we were better off with Trump in the White House, yet I thought he missed opportunities in this debate and dwelled too much on the obvious in efforts to hammer some things home.  This was more of a pissing contest than a debate.  I guess you can't argue with the fact that Trump came out on top in this 1-on-1 sling fest, but I couldn't help but wonder what direction it might have taken if an intelligent candidate such as RFK Jr. had also been on stage.  As good of a president Trump was, he did make mistakes -- a couple of which were the same mistakes made by Biden.   Biden has been just plain awful.  At the end of the day, I will probably support Trump, but we deserve to hear from a contender with similar and possibly additional skills and similar beliefs.

This is VERY simple - win the swing states, and the election is Trump's.  It's his to lose.  Tell him to control his anger better, and BE POSITIVE.  Inflation, illegal immigration, and crime...how hard can this be?  These undecided voters want ANSWERS...not defensive anger!!  

Trump was CORRECT - this debate SHOULD have been a waste of time...but in fact it wasn't where the undecided swing state voters are concerned.  They have enough sense to take a look at their grocery receipts.  Give them that much credit!  People (esp. them) vote with their pocketbooks!"	"Ugw4J1GfncXE59e09-14AaABAg"	"20510"

Veterans live on the street and they do not get help taking care of themselves despite their disability if they have family taking care of them they do not get help with the  equipment cost no matter how much disability they have because they only count service connected disability.  They do not get paid to stay home and take care of them because the service connected disability is even too hard to get the bar is set way too high. I have seen veterans walking in a walker struggling to get to and inside the grocery store because they have no one taking care of them and they have to eat They do not drive I bet they only get whatever groceries fit in their walker that they are lucky to have. Talk about neglect and abuse! Yet the immigrants in the same situation get everything free with all and extra help and special accommodations.

All I've seen are much higher prices on pretty much anything you can think of. The only thing that didn't inflate were paychecks. I've never seen any president mismanage the economy the way he has. But the wide open borders are just inexcusably insane. Millions and millions of illegal immigrants costing us billions and billions of dollars with an estimated 10% felons & hardcore felons flooding our country with drug cartel gang members,  traffickers of women and children, thieves, gun runners, sex offenders,  terrorists,  child molesters,  drug smugglers,  rapists, and murderers. What kind of person or party allows that to happen? I was a Democrat for decades but I can't deny that Trump did a much better job running this country than what we've seen from Biden. It's a rough pill to swallow but honestly Biden gave us nothing he promised while Trump gave us even much more than he promised during his first campaign. Treasury Department facts & figures give proof of that. It is obvious now Biden is not running this country. Whoever it is it's extremely bad everything they're doing and I've lost my trust in the Democratic party. They're taking us to a very dark place. Our current government is seriously corrupted and what we've got to have now is the best man to straighten things out. We all know who's the top man for that job and no matter how else you might feel about him he's one helluva fighter and knows how to win. If you bought into the media's scare tactics of dictatorship and democracy destruction don't let them fool you.  Neither will take place. The bogus felonies are just as irrelevant. Trump could be living on an island avoiding everything, but instead he's fighting for all of us. That's not a selfish man. But he's got to win in a landslide or they can cheat the ballots. We can't give them that chance. So this election our slogan is...Too Big to Rig. Just keep in mind, we may have disliked our vegetables too,  but we knew they were good for us."

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”

In the end, like someone said down below, we had a chance to regain normalcy during the Republican debates, debates Trump never attended, but we cast aside at least two, Christie and DeSantis. Haily was prominent, but the reality of it with her is that the female president barrier may have gotten her overall. It will happen one day ladies, don't worry about that. I mean Hillary didn't lose that much by Trump back then, so that is a sign. Oh well, personally, I am not looking forward to voting in November. These two are far too experienced in chaos in their own unique ways. If Biden wins, we will  continue on the path of more money problems.

Everyone has a duty to vote. I don’t understand people who refuse to frankly I don’t like either option that we got right now for the candidates so I think people should really just vote for whoever they think will do the best job as president, regardless of party I’ve never understood party loyalty but maybe that’s because I myself am an independent and I have a lot of views that are on both sides of the aisle. I’m much rather would’ve had Hillary back in 2016. I much rather would’ve had someone like say Bernie who wanted free healthcare with slightly higher taxes. I don’t like inflation I don’t like to rich I think working class families need help and they aren’t getting that. I’m really big into human rights because I’m a person who cares about other people and it’s quite distressing to see people being taken away regardless of disagree with those right or not I don’t think anybody deserves that I mean isn’t the entire reason why our founders broke off from Great Britain was to protect their rights and that is a very important thing as is the rule of law is the constitution I love this country. I don’t think it was ever not great. I think it’s always been great but I think it’s always had problems and that doesn’t mean that I’m not nationalistic. That means I’m realistic you can be national without admitting that there are problems that need to be fixed, we have an education system which is being destroyed right now by banning book banning is something that the Nazis did back in World War II and if you don’t find a problem with the Nazis doing it that’s a bigger tell us what that person is like our education system dramatically underpays teachers my fiancé is a teacher‘s aid, but she won’t even go and actively use that experience because she’ll only get paid 1425 an hour you think teachers and teachers would be paid a lot more because their teaching the next round of people some of those people are gonna go and be politicians are gonna be social service, employees or run food, shelters, or help with the homeless epidemic that our country has speaking of a homeless. Most of our veterans are homeless you think as a country that props up our military we do more to help them once they’ve gotten out of the service and are no longer in the military, it’s crazy that we don’t take care of them after they’ve gotten out of the service anyway that tangent aside I hate politics, but I care about who runs my country"	"UgzX8AUjhv8YMLcYbnF4AaABAg.A5CUaWRXNtJA5CYCqp7tYz"	"21258"
