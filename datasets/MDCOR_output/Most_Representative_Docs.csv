"V2",0.847,0.928,"(. . . - - - . . .) After this poor performance by Joe R Biden Jr. In the 2024 Presidential ‚Äúdebate‚Äù with former President Donald J. Trump, and now for Biden to have any chance to WIN the 2024 U S. Presidential election, Koe R. Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden's Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November,¬† to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? All voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr¬† would be handing the Presidential Office to His history making centrest, and Independent politicaly thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III soon after the 2024 Election 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, ‚Äúall-ready‚Äù to be a calming force often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus¬† building, Independent President demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken likable human being with excellent communications skills aa United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation‚Äôs Leaders to govern, and, most important to heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this task ahead, or the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! Joe Biden‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚ÄùTime to Man Up‚Äù. Make the right choice, at the right time who should better be the Country's Vice President who will make right these United States as the next U.S. President, and to the benifit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should br our best forward facing identity, decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential performance, and our then combined united agreement in such. So as you often say, Joe R. Biden Jr. , ‚ÄúCut The Malarkey‚Äù of having ¬†Kammla Harris as your 2024 Democratic V.P. running mate ! Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by vering away from the Political Polerrzation of today deviding ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù with a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III by your side now until November 2024. Why because a centrist moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward (. . . - - - . . .)

"V8",1,0.992,"This is how to get saved and be right with God who loves us, for eternal life! 
As there is no one who can not get saved, if they make the choice to come to God and do so. :[)

1.Realize that all of mankind have sinned before God in one way or another.

Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 
10. \"\"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:\"\"
11.\"\"There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.\"\"
12.\"\"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.\"\"
23. ‚ÄúFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.‚Äù

2.Realize that God loved us enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, by his blood shed on the cross, as a free gift given to us as sinners.

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)
8. ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\"\"
9.\"\"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.\"\"
12. ‚ÄúWherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:‚Äù

3.Confess unto God to accept this freely given gift of forgiveness, that forgives all sins.

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.\"\"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.\"\"By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.‚Äù
3.\"\"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;‚Äù
4.\"\"And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:‚Äù

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. ‚ÄúThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.‚Äù
10.\"\"For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\"\"
13.\"\"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\"\"

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.\"\"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:\"\"
28.\"\"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.‚Äù

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
\"\"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.‚Äù

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù

Lastly, here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.
‚ÄúDear God, I am a sinner and need saving. 
I know I‚Äôm not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus‚Äô name, Amen.‚Äù","Ugw4ROIZWYiFl2BRee54AaABAg","1062"

This sounds like its the exact thing China wants. If It's cheaper to do business over there, companies will move overseas. That keeps money central to China's economy (or other countries with cheaper taxes) That creates an economy where money flows from the US to foreign entities. Raising taxes won't fix anything. It will do the opposite. It will cause more inflation, prevent us from burning down our deficit, and keep our competitors in business. We need to build up our economy. We need to reward the wealthy because they are the backbone of our economy. Raising taxes won't fix frivolous government spending, it will ENCOURAGE it. We need to SPEND LESS, cut funding from programs that aren't essential and we will be fine. Less spending makes a stronger economy. When businesses have to pay more they raise prices. When they have to pay less, they charge less for their goods and services. This creates an economy that encourages spending and everyone wins.

There was a time in the US where moderate Republicans and Democrats shared common interests together, despite their political and ideological differences. It is THAT order which Trump and his cult followers have shaken up since 2016, followed by the Biden counter-block now which isn't any better either. It's bad for the peace of both sides, since they are being taken over by the extreme fringes on either side now, as I said. And this will only create more division domestically.

By the way, here in Europe and especially in Germany we have experiences over many decades with left-wing and right-wing radicals always at each other's throats, since neither of them will ever compromise to the other extreme. Hence they are not solving any problems, only creating more chaos. That's why we have additional political parties in the center in Europe who can tame both sides and introduce common ground and consensus in a professional manner accepted by everyone. They say Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy were such Presidents, to name some American equivalents in history. Bringing lefties and righties together has never been easy though.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022, the United States has provided substantial aid to Ukraine. As of early 2024, the total amount of aid approved by Congress for Ukraine stands at nearly $175 billion. This includes a mix of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.

Military Aid: The largest portion of this aid, approximately $117.4 billion, has been allocated for defense-related purposes. This includes weapons systems, training, and intelligence support for the Ukrainian military.
Economic Support: Around $34.8 billion has been provided through the Economic Support Fund, aimed at sustaining essential government services in Ukraine, such as law enforcement and other critical infrastructure.
Humanitarian Aid: An estimated $22.6 billion has been dedicated to humanitarian efforts, including support for refugees and other forms of economic assistance.

"V1",1,1,"Grocery prices in the United States did not go up by 100%, but they did see significant increases during the recent period of high inflation. Here's a detailed look at the situation:

Key Points on Grocery Price Increases:
Inflation Impact:

Inflation impacted many sectors, including groceries, with notable increases in prices. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home increased significantly from 2021 through 2023.
Percentage Increases:

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the CPI for food at home increased by 6.5% in 2021, 11.4% in 2022, and continued to rise in 2023 but did not double in price.
Specific categories saw varying increases. For example, in 2022, the prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs rose by 12.5%, and dairy products increased by 11.8%‚Äã (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)‚Äã‚Äã (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)‚Äã.
Contributing Factors:

Supply Chain Disruptions: Ongoing disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect production and distribution.
Labor Costs: Increased labor costs due to shortages and wage increases also contributed to rising prices.
Input Costs: Higher costs for raw materials, transportation, and packaging impacted the final prices of groceries.
Global Events: The Russia-Ukraine conflict further exacerbated food prices, especially affecting commodities like wheat and corn‚Äã (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)‚Äã‚Äã (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)‚Äã.
Detailed Statistics:
Meats, Poultry, Fish, and Eggs: Up 12.5% in 2022
Dairy Products: Up 11.8% in 2022
Fruits and Vegetables: Up 8.4% in 2022
Non-Alcoholic Beverages: Up 8.0% in 2022‚Äã (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)‚Äã‚Äã (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)‚Äã.

"V1",0.73,1,"Leaving NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) could have several significant negative consequences for a member country. Here are some key reasons why it might not be a good idea:

Security and Defense:

Collective Defense: NATO's principle of collective defense (Article 5) means that an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. This provides a significant deterrent against potential aggressors.
Military Support: NATO members benefit from the military capabilities and strategic assets of other member nations. Leaving NATO would mean losing access to this extensive support network.
Geopolitical Influence:

Global Influence: NATO membership enhances a country's influence on the global stage. Member states participate in high-level discussions and decision-making processes on international security and defense.
Regional Stability: NATO plays a crucial role in maintaining stability in Europe and its neighboring regions. Leaving NATO could diminish a country's influence in these areas and weaken regional security.
Economic Implications:

Defense Spending: NATO members share the burden of defense spending, which can help reduce individual costs. Outside of NATO, a country might have to increase its defense budget significantly to compensate for the loss of collective security.
Economic Security: Stability provided by NATO contributes to economic security and investor confidence. Leaving NATO could create uncertainty and negatively impact the economy.
Political Relationships:

Alliances and Partnerships: NATO fosters strong political and military alliances among member countries. Leaving could strain these relationships and isolate the country from important allies.
Diplomatic Support: Being part of NATO ensures diplomatic backing from other member countries in times of crisis. This support would be harder to come by outside the alliance.
Technological and Intelligence Sharing:

Advanced Technology: NATO members benefit from shared access to advanced military technology and innovations. Leaving NATO could limit access to such resources.
Intelligence Cooperation: NATO facilitates extensive intelligence sharing among its members. This cooperation enhances national security by providing critical information on potential threats.
Historical and Moral Commitment:

Commitment to Democratic Values: NATO promotes democratic values and the rule of law. Leaving NATO could be perceived as a step away from these principles.
Historical Alliances: Many countries have long-standing historical ties and commitments to NATO. Leaving the alliance could undermine these historical relationships and commitments.
Overall, leaving NATO could undermine national security, weaken geopolitical influence, strain economic stability, and diminish important political and military alliances. The benefits of membership, including collective defense, shared resources, and enhanced global standing, far outweigh the potential drawbacks of withdrawal.","Ugz-NXw0mr-NVxRVqDZ4AaABAg","6812"

Biden Jr. needs to make the correct strategic move, to mend the country as His legacy, which is to run with Joe Manchin III, U.S. Senator, an Independent from West Virginia, as Biden's Vice President 2024 running mate. Joe Manchin, as a proven Moderate / Centrist thinker will entice the overwhelming large number of Independent Moderate Centrist thinking U.S. Voters, sitting out the 2024 election, to go vote, in November, to elect the combined Joe R. Biden Jr. (Democrat) / Joe Manchin III (Independant) ticket. Why ? Most voters know that Joe R. Biden Jr¬† would be mentoring as the Senior Statesman He is, to eventually hand over the Presidential Office to His history-making centrest, and Independent politically thinking V.P. Joe Manchin III at any time after a 2024 Democratic Win. Joe Manchin III is without any question capable, ‚Äúall-ready‚Äù to be a calming force who is often Diplomatic, Moderate, Centrist, Consensus¬† building, Independent person. Presidenting, and demonstrating depth of intelligence, decorum, steady on display common sense leadership like that He has shown with core confidence while in the West Virginia Senate office now held. Who would not want an excellent, clear spoken, likable human being, with high integrity, showing excellent communications skills as United States President? That and so much more makes Joe Manchin III, as President, the perfect centered choice to work with all U.S. political parties, other Nation‚Äôs Leaders to govern, and, most important to reset, then heal a polarized United States electorate back to contented unity and, away from the National collective abyss coming seemingly closer each day. I can envision a President Joe Manchin the third, as a true uniter the Country needs most, having a White House Cabinet, and Administration full of moderate thinking, U.S. Citizens always and, above all, wishing to focus on a better life for We the People. An administration built from a mix Democratic, Independant, and Republican bent folks successfully managing together the people's business in a common sense first, thoughtful, daily approach fashion who foremost always emulate a President Joe Manchin III‚Äôs mannerisms. How pleasing to all it would be to have a United States Executive branch who puts People‚Äôs needs before Political Parties needs. I‚Äôm for a history making period like that, so many others would be too, as the way to reunite the United States of America while showing decorum. In NO WAY is Kamala Harris ready to assume this momentous task ahead, or even the office of the President of the United States. Joe Robinette Biden Jr., please, please set these United States of America on a healing path ! President Joe Biden, honestly it is your time to ‚ÄúMan Up‚Äù,‚Äùprotect the Country that you have sworn to protect‚Äù, and put ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù first, and above personal needs of Yourself, the desires of Family members or your best political party associate's types who , you know, most unfortunately put ‚ÄúParty First Before Country‚Äù who walk a very miss guided, warped, power first desiresies above all else agenda path. Joe R. Biden Jr. please cast these influencers aside, make the right choice, at the right time, for our Country, of who would be the better Vice President, who will make right what is not right within these United States as the next U.S. President, to the benefit of We the People within. My fellow Americans, then in 2028, when past this National debate of what should be our best forward facing identity, together when less divided we can decide again who should be U.S. President, based on your assessment of past Joe Manchin III Presidential centrest performance, and our then combined united agreement in such.

Save your Presidential legacy by taking decisive action to heal the United States by veering away from the Political Polarization of today dividing ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù with selecting a robust Uniter named Joe Manchin III to have close by your side now until November 2024, and on to Win the Whitehouse for a second term this November. Why because a centrist thinking moderate President is what the country we love needs right now, and going forward to right what's wrong with the United States read another way ‚Äúus‚Äù.

"V6",0.763,0.977,"According to Dr. John Gartner, a retired professor at John‚Äôs Hopkins Medical School, Biden‚Äôs gaffes are well within the normal limits of aging. On the other hand, Trump, whose father died of Alzheimer‚Äôs, is showing signs of real brain damage‚Äînot being old or slow or losing a step, but of severe cognitive deterioration. Trump is spiraling into ‚Äúphonemic paraphasias‚Äù during his rally speeches, which is the substitution of non-words that sound similar and are not normally seen until a patient enters the moderate to severe stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs. For example, beneficiaries became ‚Äúbenefishes,‚Äù missiles became ‚Äúmishiz,‚Äù Christmas became ‚ÄúCrissus,‚Äù and bipartisan became ‚Äúbipars.‚Äù

Please note that major risk factors for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease include advanced age (it typically occurs after age 70) and a family history of the disease.

Dr. Vincent Greenwood, Ph.D., founder of DutyToInform.org and the director of the Washington Center for Cognitive Therapy, conducted scientific research on Trump‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs language. He watched a lot of videos of Trump and Biden from when they were in their prime and recently. He then listed the specific, language-related symptoms from the DSM (the Bible for diagnosing psychiatric health conditions) associated with dementia and the same for normal aging. He counted the number of times he saw instances of each symptom. There were increases in symptoms for both Biden and Trump. Neither had significant symptoms in their prime, and both had a significant increase in symptoms from the recent videos. The big takeaway is that Trump‚Äôs increase showed dementia but not normal age-related symptoms and Biden‚Äôs showed normal age-related symptoms but not dementia.

Experts say Trump frequently speaks word salads, a sign of Alzheimer‚Äôs and other types of dementias. ‚ÄúWord salad‚Äù is a term used in psychiatry with a specific definition: severely disorganized and virtually incomprehensible speech or writing, marked by severe loosening of associations strongly suggestive of schizophrenia. The person‚Äôs associations appear to have little or no logical connection.

The transcript of Trump‚Äôs rally speech in Las Vegas, June 9, 2024, provides a good example of a word salad. In condemning electric motor mandates, he gave an anecdote about a speaking with a man who sold boats, and he mentioned, without explanation, his relationship with MIT (where his uncle taught):

So I said, \"\"Let me ask you a question.\"\" And he said, \"\"Nobody ever asks this question,\"\" and it must because of MIT, my relationship to MIT. Very smart. He goes -- I say, \"\"What would happen if the boat sank from its weight and you're in the boat, and you have this tremendously powerful battery, and the battery's now underwater, and there's a shark that's approximately 10 yards over there?\"\" By the way, a lot of shark attacks lately.

What Is a Late Termination of Pregnancy, and When Is It Legal?
Late-term abortion refers to any abortion performed after the first trimester. This is a colloquial rather than a medical term.
In most areas, exceptions allow for abortions until birth, such as rape, incest, and the mother's health.
Late-term abortions require methods other than those used within the first 12 weeks.
üìñ This article provides information on late-term abortions (e.g., gestational limits and abortion methods).

Overview
What Are Late-Term Abortions, and How Far Along in Pregnancy Can You Have One?
A late-term abortion is understood as a termination of pregnancy performed after the first trimester (i.e., after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). According to CDC's Abortion Surveillance 2021 statistics, 6.6% of US abortions are performed after week 13. Theoretically, abortions are possible up until birth. A distinction is usually made between:
Second-trimester abortions, ending at viability* at around 24 weeks,
And third-trimester abortions, starting around week 25.
*Viability is the stage at which survival outside the womb is possible.
When Is It Legal to Have a Late-Term Abortion?
If you live in an area with a threshold restriction for late-term abortions, specific reasons must be provided that allow for an exception.
Conditions for Late-Term Abortions
If a doctor deems an abortion necessary to save the mother's life, abortion is permitted in most countries, even where abortion is illegal. Other indications that may allow for a late abortion are socioeconomic, the health of the mother, fetal anomalies, rape, or incest.
This table provides you with information on late-term abortion exceptions in your region. The numbers indicate the time limit for abortion in weeks of gestation, counting from your last menstrual period (LMP), according to the specific reason provided.

Swan herself had conducted smaller studies on declining sperm counts, but in 2015 she decided it was time for a definitive answer. She teamed up with Hagai Levine, an Israeli epidemiologist, and Niels J√∏rgensen, a Danish endocrinologist, and along with five others, they set about performing a systematic review and meta-regression analysis‚Äîthat is, a kind of statistical synthesis of the data. ‚ÄúHagai is a very good scientist, and he also used to be the head of epidemiology for the Israeli armed forces,‚Äù Swan told me. ‚ÄúSo he's very good at organizing.‚Äù They spent a year working with the data. The results, when they came in, were clear. Not only were sperm counts per milliliter of s*men down by more than 50 percent since 1973, but total sperm counts were down by almost 60 percent: We are producing less s*men, and that s*men has fewer sperm cells in it. This time around, even scientists who had been skeptical of past analyses had to admit that the study was all but unassailable.
